# Re-Conceptualization of Production/Consumption in Contemporary Value-Creation Ecosystem: The Rise of Makers & Prosumers

Canberk Yurt

## Introduction

From the beginning of modernism, the patterns of production and
consumption have been challenging due to some changes in stakeholder
dynamics and social cognition. The dualities of production/consumption,
and supply/demand have been changed constantly due to the revolutions in
the value-creation ecosystem. With the emergence of postmodernism, the
collective creativity has challenged the conventional economic patterns.
The power of representing individual or social preferences in daily life
products and systems activated bottom-up creative practices. The
proliferation and democratization of self-production, DIY, and Maker
movements, and advancements in realization technologies like additive
manufacturing and crafting equipment, have enabled this social change
and support consumers to be creators; makers, and prosumers.

The phenomenon of the constant value creation cycle has always been one
of the most central concepts along the journey of civilization. Based on
anthropomorphic realizations, humankind has created complex
object/system clusters.[^11_S6_YURT_1] Social contracts and cultural dynamics have
been developed upon these clusters. Culture has been developed mostly
through the transfer and accumulation of the manmade material world and
the knowledge related to it. This dynamic has defined the way we
perceive and conceptualize the mysteries of life. As a result of this
continuous value transfer, we have transformed the habitat into an
anthropocentric realm with the cognitive boundaries of the human
mind.[^11_S6_YURT_2]

Through this transformation that mostly depends on the transformation of
virgin resources into manmade objects, humans have created another value
transfer phenomenon; economy. Initially, the concept of the economy was
positioned as “the management of the house (mother-earth)”. However,
through time, parallel to the dominant anthropocentric transformation,
it turns into “the management of material resources”.[^11_S6_YURT_3] This
anthropocentric perception of the economy has been operated through a
cyclical flow of a duality: production/consumption. Regardless of the
form of output, humans manage the material world through the production
and consumption of value clusters, and so, the economy is mostly
constructed upon the dynamics of this duality.

The value transfer phenomenon depends on the responsive activities of
the representatives who trigger the constant motion of
production/consumption. These responsive actions refer to another
crucial duality: supply/demand.[^11_S6_YURT_4] Supply/demand is the driving force
of constant value creation by multiplying the transformation of
resources into artifacts. Through time, the rhythm of supply/demand has
accelerated due to the advancements in technology, scientific
explorations, and social structure.

Regarding the various phases of value transfer that have been getting
complicated more and more, some new roles in society have been created
as parallel to changing socio-economic structures. More than producer
and consumer, roles like engineer, designer, economist, trader,
extractor, and advertiser have changed the equation of value transfer
and share. With the emergence of the Industrial Revolution, the concept
of supply/demand has found new contextual clusters due to the
perceptional changes in producer/consumer and sub-categories of
stakeholder dynamics. Modernism and then post-modernism have redefined
the roles of supply and demand by creating blurred boundaries between
producer and consumer. Initially, the transformation started by
redefining the positioning of consumers as users. Then, the
democratization of the production tools enabled consumers to become more
involved in the phases before the consumption and provided rights to
navigate design and production processes. All these contemporary changes
at the sociocultural level need to be evaluated and discussed to
conceptualize the roles of production/consumption duality.

This study aims to provide a discussion on the current positioning of
production/consumption and its sub-concepts. By analyzing the historical
context of production/consumption, the concepts like making,
prosumption, and collectivity are conceptualized regarding the roles of
value creation and value transfer. In consideration of potential aspects
of these concepts, supply/demand and profit-driven economy, some
alternative statements of value creation and transfer are analyzed. As a
result of the analysis, a conceptual framework for the maker and
prosumer concepts is defined. Following these definitions, a
characterization of value creation roles is made due to monetary,
experiential, and intersectional considerations. In the end, a
characterization diagram is created to make some further discussions.

## Transformation of Production/Consumption Through Industrialization & (Post) Modernism

Along the historical journey of production and consumption, there was a
critical step, the Industrial Revolution (1st), that radically changed
the dynamics between the stakeholders, the volume of material
transformation, the fundamentals of value creation, and the meaning of
the product as an outcome. Before the Industrial Revolution and
Proto-Industrialization,[^11_S6_YURT_5] the main economic activities are based upon
agricultural production in commonly agrarian societies. Even the
craftsmanship was driven by the raw materials produced by agricultural
practices or operated to respond to the needs of agricultural practices
and agrarian cultural patterns. The motivation for production was mostly
dependent on answering the needs of consumers with a required function
that was crafted with aesthetic interventions of local visual cultures.
Based on artisanry, society constructed the value creation/value
transfer mechanism on small-scale production due to the slow and small
consumption patterns. So, the supply/demand duality was driven through a
simpler equation and a controlled tension managed mostly just by the
producer and consumer. However, with the emergence of industrialization,
the tension between supply and demand has become complicated because of
various transitions.

First, with the transformation of low-batch production into mass
production, some intermediary steps have occurred. For instance, because
of the increasing need for raw materials, raw material extraction
practices have created their own global sector and dynamics. For
standardization and automation, raw materials initially have started to
be transformed into stock items that are processed to be new resources,
ready for production.

Second, the huge amount of produced items must have been managed with
the integration of new professions, expertise areas, sectors, and
businesses. Rather than producers, traders have started to manage the
market and the flow of the value from producer to consumer. The role of
the craftsman, who had been the absolute value creator, has been
distributed into different technical professions like engineer, foreman,
worker, manager, human resources specialist, financier, economist,
analyst, marketing specialist, salesman, retailer, logistics specialist,
and more.

Third, monetary considerations and profit-driven competition have been
more aggressive with the emergence of open market and capitalist economy
strategies. The value transfer motivation has been concentrated more on
getting a bigger piece of the profit pie. So, the triggers of value
creation have changed. Supplying a product to the market considering a
need has turned into production by imposition mentality.[^11_S6_YURT_6] “Supply for
demand” has left its place to “supply before demand”.

Fourth, the speed of consumption has also been accelerated. Long-term
usage mentality has given its place to rapid consumption patterns.[^11_S6_YURT_7]
“Throw away” and “single usage” strategies have been integrated into the
value creation cluster, parallel to the strategies of rapid consumption.
So, the quality-driven value creation dynamics have been turned into
quantity-driven value creation systematic. The linear economy concept,
“take, make, use and dispose”, has been changed when compared to the
Proto-Industrialized era. Modern humans have started to take, make, and
dispose of more while reducing the period of use (Figure 1). Parallel to
quantity-driven consumerism, the number of consumers has also increased
due to the advancements in technology and better life conditions.[^11_S6_YURT_8]
So, the capitalist production machine has extended the market, day by
day, through consumer/consumption entanglement. Following these main
transitions regarding production/consumption, the modernist era of value
creation and transfer has emerged. With the integration of structured
design discipline, the modern lifestyle has been conceptualized and
built upon daily life objects and consumer products. By designing new
needs and experiences, aimed at improving the daily lives of modern
society, the product portfolio of modern consumers has expanded.
However, with the integration of some global sociocultural,
socioeconomic, and sociopolitical incidents, the perceptions and
perspectives of societies about consumption have started to change.

Figure 1. The changing inner dynamics of linear economy (prepared by the
author)

Thus, post-modernism has emerged with a critical stance to modernism.
Contrary to modernism, post-modernism has supported the democratization
of value transfer, even in the case of a big scale of
production/consumption. Through this bottom-up movement, there have been
some transitions in consumer scale that affect the dynamics of
supply/demand. These transitions have led to grounded changes in the
perspectives and roles of consumers regarding value creation and
transfer flow.

### *Transition from Consumer to User*

In light of the post-modernist vision, consumers who had been steered in
a passive role have started to question their status in these value
creation and transfer processes. Parallel to that, on the other side of
the equation, the postmodernist design discipline has been seeking
alternative ways to better understand consumers and respond to their
needs. Human-centered design[^11_S6_YURT_9] and user-centered design[^11_S6_YURT_10]
approaches were proposed for conceptualizing the involvement of
consumers in postmodern design practices. Highlighting the importance of
experience and usability, design theory and praxis have started to
integrate consumers as active stakeholders into the processes of
designing.[^11_S6_YURT_11] Through empathizing with their experiences, consumers
have participated in value creation.

Through that change, the positioning of consumers has shifted towards
“users”. With a postmodernist mentality, the important part of the
human-object interaction has become the usage rather than the
consumption. Through methods like crowdsourcing, focus groups, and user
journey mapping, user experiences, insights, and feedback have been
gathered to be analyzed for further design processes (Figure 2). With
the emergence of new digital technologies like internet forums, online
shopping platforms’ product reviews, digital diaries, and user
experience questionnaires, the involvement and contribution of users
have been diversified.[^11_S6_YURT_12] Even users have been integrated into design
processes for maximizing democratization[^11_S6_YURT_13] within various enabler
design methods,[^11_S6_YURT_14] co-design structures, and collective
decision-making sessions. All these changes have contributed to the
social contract and collective creativity of society.

2012). (a) Eyetracking; (b) Digital diaries; (c) User journey map

Through these social innovations, the boundaries between production and
consumption have been blurred, and the interaction level in cyberspace
between the stakeholders has been developed. With the
reconceptualization of consumers as users, the dynamics of supply/demand
duality have also changed. The acceptance of users as active
stakeholders in value-creation processes by producers has directed them
to empathize with and answer to the needs, expectations, and demands of
the users, more. On the other side, the internalization of value
transfer by users makes them more confident about their rights regarding
consumption preferences and making their opinions heard about their
experiences. Producer-dominant value-creation dynamics are transformed
into user-centered design processes that focus on the user experiences.
Again, with the rapid integration of digital technologies, the
experience of a user is less on tangible objects. The experience of a
product depends on experiential value rather than material value. So,
the negotiation between producer and user becomes more than the exchange
of products and money. And the tension between the exchange value and
use value[^11_S6_YURT_15] has become more arguable.

Considering all changes in value creation and transfer, participation
and involvement, experience, and production/consumption, the
conceptualization of the user concept has triggered a cultural
transformation that stresses the boundaries between
production/consumption. With the widening impact area of users, some
newer social movements have occurred that aim to improve the
democratization of production and the decentralization of the value
creation and transfer practices.

### 

### *Transition from User to Maker & Prosumer*

Following the postmodernist vision, some collective movements led to
some conceptual changes in the involvement of users in production. These
conceptual changes are commonly focused on enabling value creation with
the independent interventions of users and their actions for forming an
alternative production culture. With the collective creativity and
commoning of certain user groups, some concepts like “maker culture” and
“prosumption” have been born. Parallel to the philosophies and
motivations of these concepts, users have created a small loop of value
creation and transfer cycle that depends on the benefits of users, again
(Figure 3).

garden initiative in Shangai, China;[^11_S6_YURT_17] (c) Rooftop PV panels for
energy prosumption by Cooperativa de Energie, Romania.[^11_S6_YURT_18]

Based on the DIY culture, maker culture has emerged with the rise of
digital and electronic technological advancements. Following the
disappearing doctrines and praxis of craftsmanship, artisanry, and
vocations, maker culture has resurrected the distributed value creation.
Makers have activated the self-production mentality[^11_S6_YURT_19] and triggered
the decentralization of production that leads to collaborative
innovation.[^11_S6_YURT_20] Unlike the neo-liberal economic concerns and
motivations of conventional modernist production mechanisms, maker
culture supports and gets supported by collective creativity,
open-source knowledge and hardware transfer, and the commoning of assets
and capital.[^11_S6_YURT_21] Rather than an inter-organizational competition, by
sharing and distributing the resources, knowledge, and tools,[^11_S6_YURT_22] maker
culture has supported pluralism and human-centered collective value
creation processes.[^11_S6_YURT_23]

Parallel to the maker movement, an alternative approach to
conceptualizing the reformation of value-creating communities is
prosumption. Prosumption is the rediscovery, redefinition, and
reinvention of functions and services by the tinkering practices of
users[^11_S6_YURT_24] to improve their experiential values and maximize the
capacity of the utility of those products. Based on the value
co-creation,[^11_S6_YURT_25] prosumer society has been formed with the motivation
of producing the content that they are willing to consume.[^11_S6_YURT_26] Through
this vision, prosumers customize the products into an upgraded version,
produce their resources like energy through small-scale production
facilities like photovoltaic panels and wind turbines.[^11_S6_YURT_27] and share
the outputs of these creations with the other members of the prosumer
society.[^11_S6_YURT_28] Through these reciprocal interactions, interventions, and
contributions to the value-creation and transfer ecosystem, just like in
the maker movement,[^11_S6_YURT_29] prosumption aims to challenge and stress the
capitalocentric economic and social patterns of production.[^11_S6_YURT_30]

Beyond the conceptual boundaries of maker and prosumer cultures, there
is a common significant impact of these two concepts on the dynamics of
production/consumption. Even their revolutionary aspects have shifted
the conceptualization of the way of value creation and value transfer.
As a result of the historical analysis, the emergence of the maker and
prosumer cultures has redefined the transition of
production/consumption. For analyzing and summarizing these long-term
changes, an illustration has been prepared (Figure 4).

![](media/image4.tiff){width="6.5in"
height="3.3569444444444443in"}Figure 4. Transformation of
production/consumption through industrialization & (post)modernism
(prepared by the author)

In the light of these critical analyses and conceptualization of the
transforming dualities of production/consumption, supply/demand,
money/experience, consumer/user, user/maker, user/prosumer, and more, a
further discussion is made.

## Conceptualization of the Maker and Prosumer Concepts in Value-Creation

Following the historical, social, cultural and economic contexts of
value creation, and literature review, maker and prosumer concepts are
defined. To understand their relationship with other stakeholders in the
value creation ecosystem and make a comparative analysis interface, a
complementary study is made. Considering all contextual relationships
described above, and two dualities with polarized elements, a coordinate
scheme is aimed to posit stakeholders due to the relevancies to certain
axes. As the poles across the Y axe, supply/demand is selected,
depending on the comparable aspects in the contextual frame, being a
consistent element through time (Figure 4) and common importance for all
stakeholders. For the X axe, money/experience duality is selected,
considering the diversifying motivational aspects for various
stakeholders, triggering specifications for the economic activities, and
impacts on the way of creating value. For this duality, their
proportional relationships are considered on the poles across the axe to
emphasize the changes more. After this base coordinate scheme is
designed, the clusters of stakeholders are conceptualized and positioned
on the scheme due to the connections with relevant dualities and other
stakeholders. With the integration and highlighting of maker and
prosumer concepts, as stakeholder clusters, the scheme is created
(Figure 5). For creating a comparative discussion in Figure 5, groups of
stakeholders are evaluated. For that, groups are selected as designer,
producer, and trader; consumer and user; and, maker and prosumer.

of the value-creation ecosystem regarding the supply/demand and
money/experience dualities (prepared by the author)

## Designer, Producer & Trader

All of them are mostly related to the supply side of the value-creation
ecosystem, while they have a little concentration on demand from the
user side of the value-creation ecosystem. When we make a comparison
among them, designers are more focused on the experiential aspects of a
product/service, while traders and producers are motivated by the
monetary aspects, like costs, profits, shares, and investments.
Designers consider experience, close to the demands of the users and the
limitations and strategies of supplying. Almost on the balance between
money and experience, the designer and producer intersect and
collaborate to supply the product/service. There is a small intersection
between trader and designer about the demands of the consumers, mostly
about monetary aspects. Following this direction, the trader is
interested in demands and supplying requirements more related to
financial issues. For almost all of the costs and profits, the trader
and producer have an intersecting cluster for supplying the
product/service.

### *Consumer & User*

Both consumers and users are on the demand side of the value-creation
ecosystem. Considering the historical context of production/consumption
and the transition from consumer to user, users are more focused on the
experiential aspects of the product/service, while consumers are
triggered more by monetary concerns. Also, consumers have a more
demanding position than users because of not being integrated into the
value-creation practices as active stakeholders. On the other side, the
unified cluster of consumer and user defines a wide range between the
poles of money and experience and supports the grounded conceptual
transition from consumer to user concept from monetary considerations
towards experience.

### *Maker & Prosumer*

As the maker movement is focused on the production side of the value
creation, a bigger proportion of makers is related to the supply part.
On the other hand, there is an obvious direction towards experiential
aspects of value creation in maker practices. However, because of the
initial costs of investment and requirements for the production tools,
makers also have monetary considerations. When we come to the prosumers,
there is an obvious concentration on monetary aspects in supplying.
Prosumers are motivated more with the financial issues for producing,
than makers. On the demanding side, experiential factors are more
prioritized than monetary factors.

Plus, the relationship between the user and the prosumer is worth
discussing. The main directional difference between the user and the
prosumer is about the reasoning of supply/demand. While users demand
products/services for experiential expectations, prosumers supply them
with financial profit motivations. This situation shows that the
prosumer concept is a negotiation between production and use, not
between production and consumption. Different from the literature that
defines prosumption as a combination of consumption and production,[^11_S6_YURT_31]
prosumer is the hybridization of producer and user in practice.

Together, makers and prosumers define a widened cluster that has a
vertical diversity between supplying and demanding, horizontal
accumulation towards experiential aspects. This characteristic presents
an original conceptual frame for the value-creation ecosystem by being
less dependent on financial motivations, neo-liberal strategies, and
capitalist impositions. This postmodernist attitude creates a critical
stance to the conventional economic understanding and stresses the
future of a linear economy that depends on the financial capital and
central economy. With the rise of the maker and prosumer movements,
decentralization of economic activities, and the power of collective
creativity based on intellectual capital become crucial for the
value-creation ecosystem. Through the integration and condensation of
the maker and prosumer mentality, the transition from linear to circular
practices can be enabled because of the active involvement of users in
the circular value creation practices. So, continuity and circularity of
value creation are promising considerations for maker and prosumer
concepts to analyze through further studies. Besides, being positioned
far away from the monetary considerations creates economic concerns
about the expansion and viability of the maker and prosumer concepts in
the long run. Within financially dominant economic patterns, the
acceptance and density of maker and prosumer concepts can be misled or
downsized. So, questioning the distribution of economic share is another
consideration to discuss for further studies about maker and prosumer
concepts.

## Conclusion

Constantly changing dynamics of the social structure challenge how we
manage the value creation processes and their impacts on society.
Parallel to the sociocultural, socioeconomic, and sociopolitical
incidents, the transformation of the roles and the interaction among
them is crucial to conceptualizing and comprehending the ongoing
tendencies and further possible scenarios for value creation practices.
This research proposes a conceptual framework for contemporary
production/consumption duality by tracking the historical context and
cause-effect relationships. Along this direction, maker and prosumer
movements are discussed regarding their conceptual positioning within
the contexts of production/consumption, supply/demand, experience/money,
etc. Following the literature on maker culture, prosumption, collective
creativity, and user-centeredness, a comparative structure is created to
process the discussions about the current and possible future scenarios
of the maker and prosumer concepts.

Considering the theoretical discussions and comparative analysis from
the point of the stakeholder of value creation, there is a need for
further research to ground these discussions and characterize the maker
and prosumer concepts. For questioning and testing the statements in
this research, a case study based on real-life experiences and insights
is aimed to be planned and applied. Parallel to the collective and
democratic structure of the maker and prosumer cultures, a case study
will be designed to gather diversified insights from the most common
maker and prosumer sub-concept practitioners. Within the structured
research design, the insights will be assessed through some predefined
considerations to reach some tangible outputs to define characteristics
of the maker and prosumer concepts. As a result of this
characterization, some statements and provisions about the future of
maker and prosumer concepts can be identified and presented in the
literature.
