# From Social Innovation to Open Innovation: A Framework on Open Paradigm Clusters in Design Research on Providing Systemic Change Through Crowdsourcing

Anıl Dinç Demirbilek

## Introduction

As an ever-evolving field, design has become the main driver for
innovation, development and change for the society. From a conventional
perspective, design has been considered to operate between the
intersection point between “industrial” and “artistic” expressions,
which altered for desired outcomes. It has been observed that throughout
the years this evident connection between two spectrums has loosened and
design itself has become an openly accessible medium for anyone to
utilize for varied purposes and interventions. Within this shift from
closed and exclusive systems to open and transparent structures, open
paradigm (OP) has emerged within the design field to signify the
openness ideology on both theoretical and practical approaches.
Throughout this paradigm shift, design has been considered as a vital
tool to enhance social innovation and its related deliveries as design
outputs to propose the framework of open innovation. Having placed
within the fundamental clusters of OP, open innovation suggests the
utilization of crowdsourcing approach within the design discourse to
include varied actors within the innovation ecosystem on product and
design development processes.

The design discipline has become the primary force for progress,
innovation, and new results for society since it is a constantly
changing field that is closely linked to industry and mass production.
Considering the term as a unification between artistic expressions and
manufacturing technologies, design alters the way we think, create and
diffuse[^12_S7_Demirbilek_1] .Although, the bond between these two points within the
innovative spectrum is strong and evident, its integrated connection has
loosened throughout the years and progressive developments.[^12_S7_Demirbilek_2]
Regarding the emerging issues and topics revolving around design
research field, introduction of critical thinking about design, its goal
and its foundational positioning within the society have been altered as
a paradigm shift.

Regarding these developments, the literature dedicated to this framework
has developed significantly throughout the years.[^12_S7_Demirbilek_3] Related
terminologies like co-creation, co-design, participatory design, open
design, crowdsourcing and open source are only brief examples from the
general scope of this emerging area. This led into the definition of
open paradigm (OP) in design field and more specifically OP in design
research to signify this paradigm shift as a unified structure.[^12_S7_Demirbilek_4]

Having placed as a vital concept under the discourse of the design
profession, the paradigm itself suggest the need on contemporary
perspectives towards the realization of systemic changes through
innovation, especially within the social scales to enable holistic
improvements and developments complimented by design. This specific need
has become evident, since design has been considered as a vital factor
which tackles social issues to provide innovation.[^12_S7_Demirbilek_5] Thus, within the
OP, it is possible to establish a concise perspective towards the
influential dynamics which have the potential to realize social
innovation (SI) and relevant outputs.

SI defines a specific process of change and alteration via the
combination of existing assets through creative re-combination.[^12_S7_Demirbilek_6] In a
way, it is an explicit statement of innovation, which is for the social
and public good.[^12_S7_Demirbilek_7] But what happens if were to include the OP and its
essential clusters within the SI frameworks, within the outlines of the
design discourse, can be considered as an important question for the
scope of this chapter. On a contemporary level, open collaboration and
communication between multiple stakeholders have been proposed as a
catalyst, which can improve the true impact of SI.[^12_S7_Demirbilek_8] This proposition
has been considered as a critical topic within the current global
societies which have been affected through the political, environmental
and economic structures. Therefore, and openly accessible and
collaboratively shaped approaches within the concept of SI can foster
sustainable growth and development.[^12_S7_Demirbilek_9]

Referring to OP’s main approach on considering multiple actors within
design processes, it is also possible to acknowledge the large spectrum
of innovation ecosystems through the set of people, communities,
institutions, policies and resources.[^12_S7_Demirbilek_10] Because of this nature, SI
demands the contributions across disciplines and sectors,[^12_S7_Demirbilek_11]
consisting of non-designer participants as well. Regarding this demand,
OP within the social scale has the potential to become fueled by the
crowd and data derived from their perspectives. Thus, as an essential
cluster of OP, crowdsourcing approach suggests the further investigation
towards the transition from SI to open innovation to realize
systemically changes.

## The Concept of “Openness” in Design Research

Considering design as an evolving and openly accessible medium within an
emerging framework, advancements in new technologies and emerging
digital tools have accelerated the general process of design to alter
its boundaries, regarding the distribution of design-based knowledge and
alternative methods. It has become possible to identify the influence of
users and non-designer participants on the overall design processes and
even manufacturing phases of both tangible and intangible outputs. New
technological possibilities for ordinary people to collaborate are
enabling new ways of performing creative actions and participating in
design and production. This challenges our way of thinking design and
production and affects the landscape of collaborative design research
and practice.[^12_S7_Demirbilek_12]

As a result, the openness ideology and the process of design itself,
have begun to signify a larger term that defined as “open paradigm in
the field of design or open paradigm in design research.[^12_S7_Demirbilek_13] In the
literature, it is also possible to focus on the identification of
foundational aspects related to OP in design research field. According
to the preliminary research, the general structure of the paradigm
consists of the main aspects of *open products* and *open
processes.*[^12_S7_Demirbilek_14]

-   *Open Products*: The initial aspect mainly refers to the creation
    and proposition of new products and related development structures.
    Within the provided framework of OP, given aspect suggests the
    utilization of free and open-source seawares as well as the usage of
    open-source hardware, especially on manufacturing processes.[^12_S7_Demirbilek_15]

-   *Open Processes:* Second aspect signifies the collective or
    collaborative efforts of multiple and varied actors from different
    professional backgrounds to provide desired outcomes, specifically
    for the development processes of new product and outputs.

Regarding these two main aspects, the paradigm mainly focuses on the
democratization of decision-making processes, which allow the users and
other participants to acknowledge their roles on providing long term
innovative change and alterations.

## The Four Essential Clusters of Open Paradigm

The four clusters of open paradigms provide a contemporary
categorization regarding the two main aspects of the paradigm’s overall
structure.[^12_S7_Demirbilek_16] Utilizing the preliminary approach provided by the
literature,[^12_S7_Demirbilek_17] following adapted table presents certain methodologies
to further define the general scope of the paradigm. Within this scope,
it is possible to acknowledge four main clusters as: OS (Open-source
approach), CO (Collaborative approach), CR (Crowd approach), OM (Open
manufacturing approach). Following adapted table 1. illustrates each
methodological approach under the classification of two main aspects of
*open products* and *open processes.*

  ------------------ ---------------------- ---------------------- ------------------------------------------

As it can be observed from the table, each cluster shape and define the
general structure of the paradigm itself. Within the scope of this
research, the crowd approach has been selected as a vital contributive
cluster to further examine the transition from socially innovative
practices to openly accessible perspectives and approaches from a
business level perspective. Since crowdsourcing refers to the
propositions of solutions to different issues, while utilizing the
wisdom of the crowd,[^12_S7_Demirbilek_18] given term selected as the main driver behind
enhancing the process of providing systemic change as a long-term
result. Following part ventures briefly through the cluster of CR and
establish the main theoretical plane for the review on the effect of
crowdsourcing method on providing open innovation.

## Crowd Approach

CR approach refers to the inclusion of wide amount of people to
development and production processes. However, different than any
collaborative practice, CR signifies the integration of specific crow
from respective ecosystems to alter and define a new step of proposing
change and innovative acts. Through the emergence of digital platforms
and infrastructures, CR approach has enhanced its scope on providing
eventual systemic change, referring to the general scope of social
innovation. On a contemporary level, it has become possible to realize
the contribution of communities and certain group of users to propose
ideas or solutions on multiple levels of product and service
development, from a business level perspective.[^12_S7_Demirbilek_19] Selected cluster
further signifies the constant information provided by users and
participants allow designers and companies to estimate the true issues
regarding the operational aspects dedicated to various product-service
and system structures. Through this process, it becomes possible to
provide efficient and well-defined design solutions, regarding usage,
distribution and dissemination of outputs both on physical and
intangible mediums.

## Open Innovation Through Crowdsourcing

Differing from the foundational and conventional approaches of social
innovation, open innovation (OI) presents the ability to use external
knowledge as an internal asset, derived from external organizations,
users, partners, universities and research organizations for companies
and businesses.[^12_S7_Demirbilek_20] Having emerged as a new spectrum, especially on
management studies, OI introduced as a new paradigm, which refers to the
enhancement on innovative capabilities of a company through the
interaction with other external organizations and actors.[^12_S7_Demirbilek_21] As a
complimentary yet an important factor regarding the realization of OI
has been considered as crowdsourcing.[^12_S7_Demirbilek_22] Moreover, it has been stated
that crowdsourcing has become one of the most frequently referred
keyword within OI literature and research dedicated to the
framework.[^12_S7_Demirbilek_23]

Referring to the significance of the “crowd” for the realization of
socially innovative outcomes, the bond between each of these main
aspects has been defined as a widely accepted tool, especially for
commercial and business level operations.[^12_S7_Demirbilek_24] Referring to the CR from
OP’s main clusters, for constant innovation companies started to utilize
the crowdsourcing method to open and eliminate their boundaries to
gather external expertise for varied agendas, instead of collaborating
or communicating with the only selected few of external
collaborators.[^12_S7_Demirbilek_25] Essentially this process refers to an alteration of
a company’s own management structure, since crowdsourcing enables the
involvement of external actors to the development processes, instead of
internal research and development steps.[^12_S7_Demirbilek_26] Furthermore, OI and
crowdsourcing are essentially in unison and derived from the same
paradigm as the distribution of knowledge becomes an openly accessible
process, thus eventually has the potential to provide competitive
advantage for firms in terms of research and development processes.[^12_S7_Demirbilek_27]

To provide a totally integrated view on the given spectrum, a new model
which illustrates the intersection point of OI and crowdsourcing method
has emerged within the given discourse.[^12_S7_Demirbilek_28] Following adapted figure
represents the overall structure through four main dimensions, revolve
around this mentioned intersection.

**Figure 1.** The main dimensions of open innovation and crowdsourcing
(Source: Cricelli, Grimaldi and Vermicelli, 2022, p: 1297).

As it can be observed from the figure, the intersection points between
OI and crowdsourcing consist of four main diverged dimensions as;
*strategic, managerial, technological* and *behavioral*. This specific
characterization provides the essential connection between these
selected two main spectra. Furthermore, each sub-component under four
main dimensions, tolerate the overall delivery and the realization of
the main framework of crowdsourcing approaches.

## Crowdsourcing for New Design Proposals

Referring to the overall scope of this chapter, following part provides
a contemporary look and discussions on several examples as companies,
which have been utilizing crowdsourcing method to provide innovative
results, both tangible and intangible levels. Each case was selected
from post 2000s to further analyze the usage of crowdsourcing approach
under the main framework of OP to establish a contemporary framework
within the methodology.

One of the significant examples for the utilization of crowdsourcing
approach can be considered from Fisher-Price. The parent company of
Fisher-Price, “Mattel” has been considered as one of the leading brands,
which utilized crowdsourcing to develop new designs for their toy lines.
Derived from their own social network structures, gathered ideas from
varied user have helped the brand to come-up with new design
propositions, as well as allowed them to realize this process with a
more controllable budget.

Regarding the utilization of digital platforms, IKEA has launched its
“Co-Create” platform back in 2018, which aims to gather new ideas from
its customers and to collaborate with university students or novice
designers to produce new product design propositions. As a
well-established furniture retailer, IKEA has also realized the
potential contribution of the selected design method to further develop
new solutions and innovative results, while also focusing on the
involvement of non-designer participants within the process to gather
relevant data and information.

For the realization of the open innovation and relevant approaches, a
crucial example as a case can be provided through BMW’s crowd innovation
platform. The platform enables both internal and external crowds to
develop, evaluate and share ideas, regarding the design propositions
within the scope of the brand’s main innovation line. According to BMW’s
approach, the platform prioritizes a swarm intelligence model, which
focuses on the collective behavior to decentralize decision-making
processes. Launched back in 2021, the Crowd Platform has been constantly
promoting its own attitude towards the crowdsourcing approach and
allowed other participants to become a part of ideation and developments
phases, regarding new product development.

While innovation demands the need of varied stakeholder from both
internal and external structures, another supportive case can be
considered from the brand Nestlé. Through the InGenius platform, Nestlé
aims to innovative within their own product line through the application
of crowdsourcing approach within their own management structure.
According to the main process of the platform, Nestlé has divided each
development phases into four main pillars (*opportunities, incubation*,
*co-innovation* and *deliverance*). The overall development process
provides new opportunities to consumers on proposing ideas about desired
product delivery methods as well as allows them to gain prizes in return
to their collaborative efforts.

As it can be derived from each individual case, the crowdsourcing has
been defined as a beneficial tool, especially when it comes to the
openly accessible design delivery structures. In accordance with the
OP’s main framework, selected cases represent the potential utilization
of the mentioned approach on altering the social innovation concept into
open innovation as a final delivery channel.

## Conclusion

As a conclusive statement, the general structure of OP and its essential
clusters signify the need for new perspectives and practical
applications, relating the distribution of design-based knowledge and
data. Within the scope of this research, a small glance through the
given clusters has been investigated to identify the contemporary
applications of OP and how the shift within the total paradigm has
influenced organizational structures. Within the given scope,
crowdsourcing has emerged as an innovative method to gather relevant
data for further design development stages contributed by users, actors
and non-designer participants.

Having placed under the categorization of CR (crowd approach) of OP’s
main spectrum, crowdsourcing has been considered as a vital element
within the overall flow of design and product development stages, thus
for the total realization of systemic change as an openly accessible
phenomenon. Regarding this consideration, the findings and the general
investigation of this research suggests the apparent role of OP’s main
structure between the transition of social innovation and open
innovation practices. Crowdsourcing method under the design discourse
has been considered the main path through the realization of this change
and its overall dynamic within organizational structures has been
defined through contemporary cases. For future research, the total
structure of OP clusters provides potential research areas to further
investigate the total process of how design is becoming an openly
accessible and a transparent field for varied participants. Furthermore,
it is also possible to consider crowdsourcing approach and its relevant
practices on different scales as well, such as institutional and public
usage levels.
