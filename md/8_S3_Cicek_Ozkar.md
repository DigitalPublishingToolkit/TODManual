# Opening up the Design Space of the Basic Design Studio

Selen Çiçek

Mine Özkar

## Introduction: Hermeneutical cycle of the basic design studio

The concept of design space holds a crucial position in the theoretical
landscape of computational design and engineering, yet its diverse
assumptions—ranging from a mere display medium for solution alternatives
to a potential interactive platform between designers and design
problems—remain enigmatic. The chapter delves into the unexplored
territory of the design space within educational frameworks, with a
specific focus on the challenges posed by basic design studios for
novice designers. By reframing the design space within the context of
the basic design studio and revisiting its theoretical foundations, this
exploration aims to unravel the creative potential inherent in design
space as a medium for to “see-move-see” by reconstructing design
problems and representing solutions. The potential strategies for
generating the design space are contemplated, especially in the dynamic
realm of evolving generative AI. This chapter delves into the uncharted
possibilities of the design space, picturing it as a conceptual tool
woven into the context of the basic studio process—a medium fostering
the "see-move-see" dynamic.

Basic design studio stands as the foundation for all design related
disciplines for teaching novice designers how to reason for design.
Despite its crucial role, first year of design education is generally
conceived as the most challenging phase of whole curriculum, when it is
asked to fellow graduates. The reason behind this statement can be
extended into a variety of different factors in the studio. However, the
main reason and the underlying cause of previously mentioned situations
might be the “design reasoning” concept, which novice designers have not
been acquainted with, yet. Since the novice students have no previous
design experience, to solve ambiguous design problems that are not well-
defined, guiding them is significantly important in the journey of
understanding the rationality behind the design process.

In a conventional studio setup, there is an inherent hermeneutical cycle
between the actors: students, peers and instructors. The students,
novice designers, generally lack contextual knowledge about the set-up
and the content of the studio. Tacit knowledge brought by the previous
education stages are not helpful enough for them either, since they
usually trained to solve well-defined problems, which are often
structured with singular goal and seeks for absolute truth or one-way
valid answer. Having been accustomed to deriving instant solutions to
those problems through pre-established methods and formulas in primary
and secondary education, students are not used to question the nature of
design problems or developing methodologies to address them (Figure 1).

Figure 1. Proposed hermeneutical sketch of the basic design studio.

During the process of solution generation, the novice designer learns to
reconstruct the design problem by the two-fold of reflective action
practiced in the studio: feedback sessions with the design instructors;
learning-by-doing paradigm. The design problem definitions given in the
form of assignment briefs generally inherits both ill- and well-defined
problems at the same time. Although the problem definitions remain same,
the implicit statements delivered by the briefs get explicated by the
interactions with the studio instructors during the panel critiques that
held after the initial solutions are generated. Besides, the points that
need to be reconsidered in those solutions get highlighted during this
feedback session, which enables students to learn from their own
solutions by developing them. Hence, student's tacit knowledge in the
beginning, evolves into a buildup contextual knowledge by the end of the
term by the explicit usage of terminology and vocabulary. This
corresponds to the one of the main learning outcomes of the studio as
teaching the key concepts and principles of design.

In that context, we believe that the “Design Space” might be a
conceptual tool in the basic design studio set-up, for representing the
reasoning process of the novice designers, not only by the generated
solutions but also through the reflective practice of the studio
process. Therefore, by revisiting the definitions in the concept in wide
range of computational design and engineering literature, we tend to
reframe the concept in an educational framework to underline the
implementation potentials of the concept in the basic design studio.

## Reconstruction and representation of design problems

The definitions of design as an ill-structured or wicked problem
highlight distinct characteristics. However, both share a common initial
conflict: the formulation of the design problem arises after specific
intents or actions by the designer. This is because the ambiguous nature
of the problem prevents the clear revelation of its goal and
intermediate stages before any solution attempts are made.[^8_S3_Cicek_Ozkar_1] The
design object and medium undergo changes as a result, with these
alterations becoming apparent only through the designer's attempts.
These changes extend beyond modifications in material properties that
can be sensed on the design medium; they also influence the designer's
perception, allowing for the recognition of new characteristics in the
existing material.

Stiny[^8_S3_Cicek_Ozkar_2] further explores these changes and their impact on the process
within the context of shape grammar. He emphasizes the significance of
change, which goes beyond visual implications, encompassing perceptual
shifts introduced by the introduction of seemingly useless rules.
Integrating perceptual changes into the process introduces an additional
layer of ambiguity, emphasizing the need to reconstruct design problems
both perceptually and visually for representation.

Design problems, characterized by ambiguity and uncertainty, are deemed
essential for fostering creativity and innovation in the design
processes.[^8_S3_Cicek_Ozkar_3] While other fields aim to eliminate such ambiguities in
the solution delivery process, design-related realms view them as
creative resources for emerging applications, urging designers not to
overlook or suppress them.[^8_S3_Cicek_Ozkar_4] Despite this, there is recognition that
designers play a crucial role in controlling these ambiguities
throughout the process to systematically address the given design
problem.[^8_S3_Cicek_Ozkar_5] Thus, the primary objective for designers becomes the
production of coherent and internally consistent design outputs,
achieved by developing new methodologies to exert control without
leaving room for coincidences.

Herbert Simon's approach to design as a problem-solving activity
proposes a mechanism for addressing ill-defined design problems. He
suggests breaking down the complexity of such problems into "smaller,
more manageable sub-problems that can potentially be well-defined."[^8_S3_Cicek_Ozkar_6]
In Simon's terminology, the "representation" becomes pivotal for
delivering solutions to ill-defined problems.

His initial assertion emphasizes that explicitly representing each stage
of the interrelated design process on a visible medium enables the
development of corresponding solutions. However, the limited cognitive
abilities of humans hinder the representation of intermediate stages on
the visual medium. This limitation prevents the easy anticipation of
potential alternative answers after specific moves have been made. He
illustrates this situation with the familiar analogy of an ant trying to
find its way home:

> Whoever made the path, and in whatever space, why is it not straight;
> why does it not aim directly from its starting point to its goal?...
> He has a general sense of where home lies, but he cannot foresee all
> the obstacles between them. He must adapt his course repeatedly to the
> difficulties he encounters and often detours uncrossable barriers. His
> horizons are very close so that he deals with each obstacle as he
> comes to it; he probes for ways around or over it, without much
> thought for future obstacles. It is easy to trap him into deep
> detours.[^8_S3_Cicek_Ozkar_7]

The ant's deviation from its path, prompted by obstacles and
environmental changes, presents a dual challenge. The obstacles
initially defined and those arising during the journey due to
environmental shifts are key factors influencing the ant's altered
route. However, these are not the sole contributors. The ant's
constrained cognitive capacity to foresee future disruptions caused by
the environment also significantly contributes to the deviation in its
course.

Drawing an analogy from Simon's ant to the design education framework,
novice designers can be likened to ants attempting to solve design
problems in the basic design studio. Much like the ants, the cognitive
abilities of these students are limited, hindering their ability to
foresee the upcoming stages of the design process due to a lack of prior
experience. The assignment briefs, serving as the design problems in the
basic design studio, constitute the defined task environment. These
briefs introduce disruptions on the fly, altering the designer's
perception and the expected solution delivery process. Consequently,
students might encounter significant detours during the process, as
their learning of design is primarily experiential, lacking a structured
foundation.

This strategy often defined in the educational frameworks as “learning
by doing” paradigm in terms of achieving knowledge and experience
through trial-and-error mechanisms which represents a crucial form of
reasoning.[^8_S3_Cicek_Ozkar_8] Schön defines the overall educational context of the
design studio as a reflective practicum, where students learn design by
actively engaging in it with guidance from the design studio instructor:

> Studios are typically organized around manageable projects of design,
> individually or collectively undertaken, more or less closely
> patterned on projects drawn from actual practice. They have evolved
> their own rituals such as matter demonstrations design reviews desk
> critics and design juries all attached to the core process of learning
> by doing.[^8_S3_Cicek_Ozkar_9]

The reflective conversation between the student and the design object
gains strength through dialogue and critiques from the coach. The
student becomes more adept in design reasoning during
reflection-in-action. The definition of design as a reflective practice
or act of making may initially appear contradictory to the
problem-solving perspective of design, particularly in terms of
attitudes toward the design problem-solution process. Since Simon
attempts to decipher the design problem and its solution process
explicitly through rationalization, whereas Schön elaborates on design
as an act of making, corresponding to an implicit understanding of the
essence of the design problem. Schön criticizes the neglect of essential
aspects of the problem, such as inherent ambiguities and uncertainties,
cautioning against reducing designing to a “process of optimization”:

> (Herbert Simon’s) view ignores the most important functions of
> designing in situations of uncertainty, uniqueness, and conflict where
> instrumental problem solving- and certainly optimization- occupy a
> secondary place if they have a place at all. In contrast, I see
> designing as a kind of making.[^8_S3_Cicek_Ozkar_10]

Despite the initial divergence in the perspectives of two influential
design researchers regarding the design process, viewed from the design
education context, both attitudes towards design problems can be seen as
converging. The common ground is the need for explicit or implicit
clarification of design problems during the process. This clarity is
crucial to empower novice designers in representing and reconstructing
problems on the design medium, providing visibility for informed
decision-making as in a form of “see-move-see” pattern. However, the
specific medium for this convergence remains unidentified, posing a
challenge in leveraging it as a tool in design education for teaching
novice design students how to reason for design.

In this context, the concept of Design Space emerges as a promising
medium for representing the reflective action of design occurring within
the design studio, shaped by the contributions of actors in the
hermeneutical cycle of the studio including students and instructors.
The definitions of the design space concept exhibit significant
variability across a broad spectrum of computation-related literature.
Some perspectives view it solely as a display case for generated design
solution alternatives, while others interrogate it as a design tool in
generative application processes.[^8_S3_Cicek_Ozkar_11] Despite extensive discussions on
the computational structures of the concept, particularly regarding its
construction and exploration, there is a scarcity of research focusing
on the abilities it provides for the designer.[^8_S3_Cicek_Ozkar_12]

Yet in the basic design education framework, the design space term
barely finds itself a place; besides the role of it mere as a solution
space, in few applications held in courses that focuses on
computer-aided design. Revisiting the concept of Design Space, we
navigate through its varying definitions in computational literature,
emphasizing its potential as a medium for representing the reflective
action of design in the studio.

## On the Design Space

The concept of design space is characterized by imprecise metaphors and
unspoken assumptions, manifesting in various forms within the design
research field 10. Traditionally defined as "the aggregation of all
possible design solutions in a given task," it also encompasses the
evolving space of potentialities created by a designer during the design
process.[^8_S3_Cicek_Ozkar_13] Additionally, the design space concept is portrayed as a
network representing the structure of related designs explored during
the design process.[^8_S3_Cicek_Ozkar_14]

While often considered a "descriptive metaphor" for collections of
design ideas,[^8_S3_Cicek_Ozkar_15] the concept assumes various roles across design and
computation-related literature, spanning engineering, architecture,
visual communication, and interactive design realms. In this context,
the conceptual network graph of the design space is presented in Figure
2, with nodes corresponding to keywords found in revisited publications.

![](media/image2.jpeg){width="6.143939195100613in"

related contexts and keywords found in revisited publications. (Author
nodes are depicted in blue, while articles written collaboratively are
highlighted with light blue edges.)

In various contexts, the design space concept is emphasized with
different characteristics, yet the central focuses remain largely
consistent. These include capturing the activities of a designer in
interacting with the conceptual space, along with generating alternative
solutions for revisitation and the creation of new designs. However,
recognizing the sub-spaces within the concept reveals deterministic
differences regarding the role of design space in the design process,
specifically whether it enables the display and interaction with the
process.

One perspective considers the design space concept as a combination of
problem space and solution space, viewing the design process as a binder
for these subsets.[^8_S3_Cicek_Ozkar_16] Conversely, another group of researchers
perceives the term as exclusively forming from the solution space of
alternatives generated under the design brief. Therefore, to guide the
reader's understanding, it is crucial to revisit previous works in the
literature dealing with the design space conception under two main
groups of understandings: first, the design space as merely solution
space, and secondly, design space as the reciprocal formation of problem
and solution spaces (Figure 3).

design space concept.

### *Design space as mere solution space*

We now dissect the dichotomy in understanding Design Space, beginning
with perspectives that perceive it solely as a solution space, focusing
on the display and analysis of alternative solutions.

Westerlund[^8_S3_Cicek_Ozkar_17] defines this understanding as a conceptual tool for
designing an explorative and experimental design process with the
generated solutions. He excludes the problem space from the concept,
arguing that the wicked nature of design problems prevents full
exploration of the problem space even if represented in the design
space. Instead, the solutions displayed in the design space encompass a
variety of characteristics to articulate the essence of the design work.

In a similar vein, recent research by Halskov, Dove, and Fischel builds
on the concept of design space as a display case of alternative
solutions. In this research, the design space serves as a tool to
construct and analyze precedent design challenges within the knowledge
process.[^8_S3_Cicek_Ozkar_18] They present a case study of a design space constructed
with fifty-four examples from the Media Architecture Biennale. These
examples are deconstructed to identify inherent common patterns of
characteristics, creating a holistic design space for viewing,
navigating, and filtering purposes.

Similarly, Mei et al. reconstruct the design space concept as a tool for
visualizing a literature review on information visualization tools.[^8_S3_Cicek_Ozkar_19]
They classify cases in the literature, constructing the design space
medium based on predefined dimensions such as degree of abstraction,
presentation medium, supported data source, and action type.

### *Design space as combination of problem and solution spaces *

Shifting our focus, we explore perspectives that incorporate both
problem and solution spaces within Design Space, aligning with the
iterative nature of design problems and the coevolution of solution
spaces. Dorst[^8_S3_Cicek_Ozkar_20] notes that since the process aims to deliver a design
solution, the solution space coevolves with the problem space. Design
research theorists suggesting the problem space as inherent imply that
the defined problem's iterative reconstruction alters or enhances the
generated set of alternatives in the solution space in terms of quantity
and quality.

Cross[^8_S3_Cicek_Ozkar_21] ties the ambiguous nature of design problems to the
difference between expert and novice designers. Novice designers,
lacking experience, struggle to deliver solutions to unclearly formed
problems, limiting the solution space. Cross explains the designer's
exploration and discovery process in exploring the problem space and
generating initial ideas for the solution space.

Woodbury and Burrow[^8_S3_Cicek_Ozkar_22] align with Cross's perspective, emphasizing the
importance of representing the problem space in their keynote article on
understanding the structure of the design space. They underscore the
significance of enabling designers to generate new designs by navigating
among previously discovered ones in the network. This involves moving
among examples in the problem space to create new solutions, aligning
with the see-move-see pattern of understanding the design process.
Designers often build upon previous moves during reflection-in-action,
so seeing a variety of alternatives in the problem space expands the
solution space when both are represented. Computational structures aid
in representing the vast set of alternative problem reconstructions in
the design space.

height="5.848611111111111in"}Figure 4. Boundaries of the design process.
(Woodbury, R. F., & Burrow, A. L.; 2006)

Dennet[^8_S3_Cicek_Ozkar_23] clarifies that this vastness is valuable when designers can
access "unsound" designs from potential points in the contingent
historical accounts defined in the space. In this context, "unsound"
refers to ambiguities arising in the process due to perceptual and
visual changes. These ambiguities, challenging to represent clearly,
might be valuable in the design space concept for reaching unsound,
creative, undiscovered solutions. (Figure 4). As both researchers
suggest, amplifying the number of solutions is possible by viewing
design space as inseparable from the problem space.

Goldschmidt[^8_S3_Cicek_Ozkar_24] adds that the designer's movement among previously
generated solutions in the design space not only offers crucial feedback
on solutions but also highlights the design process. Emphasizing design
reasoning and interconnected links, Goldschmidt underscores the need to
consider non-represented actions in both problem and solution spaces for
a comprehensive understanding of the design space, including the
process.

In agreement, Ömer Akın, responding to the same keynote article, points
out tasks still incomplete in the design space framework drawn by
Woodbury and Burrow.[^8_S3_Cicek_Ozkar_25] He highlights that the non-graphic content of
a design, often considered in the context of design requirements, which
we can recall as design problems, are not yet adequately represented on
the medium itself.

Van Langen and Braziers elaborate on the design space concept,
incorporating problem and solution space under three subsets of the
design process: partial descriptions of design artifacts, the space of
design requirements, and the space of design objectives.[^8_S3_Cicek_Ozkar_26] 20. Design
requirements and design objectives can be viewed as outliers of the
problem space, defining characteristics of the given design brief, while
partial descriptions of generated design artifacts align with the
solution space.

Beyond theoretical debates on the design space concept, practical
research in the literature aims to establish a solid connection between
problem and solution spaces. Erhan et al. propose a methodology for
discovering "unsound" alternatives by enabling designer interaction with
many alternatives in the design space through similarity-based
exploration.[^8_S3_Cicek_Ozkar_27] They model a task environment encompassing both
problem and solution space, allowing dynamic alterations in the problem
space, leading to an immediate expansion of the solution space.

Perisic, Martinec, Storga, and Gero present results from a computational
design experiment on design teams, demonstrating the effects of
experience in exploring problem and solution spaces.[^8_S3_Cicek_Ozkar_28] Aligned with
Nigel Cross's perspective, they assert that accumulated experience in
design space exploration aids in developing solutions to design problems
more efficiently, and ongoing collaborative work enhances the design
situation. Their agent-based simulation experiment provides solid
evidence for the process of design space expansion.

Gero and Kumar address the introduction of new design variables and
constraints to the problem space, showcasing how new solution spaces
emerge.[^8_S3_Cicek_Ozkar_29] They illustrated this through various design experiments in
contexts like mathematical problem spaces conducted on Cartesian
geometry, small-scale housing design, and structural beam design. These
experiments demonstrate the expansion of solution spaces by adding new
constraints to the problem space.

## Discussion: How to generate the design Space of the basic design studio?

In exploring the intricate perspectives surrounding the concept of
Design Space, our journey aligns with the iterative nature of design
problems and the coevolution of solution spaces. As we delve into this
intrinsic connection between problem and solution spaces, particularly
emphasized in delivering a design solution, its paramount relevance
surfaces in the context of basic design education. Novice designers,
reminiscent of Simon’s ants navigating uncertain terrains,[^8_S3_Cicek_Ozkar_30] grapple
with unclearly formed problems, amplifying the significance of
understanding and navigating the problem space to expand the solution
space.

The struggle faced by novice designers underscores the pivotal
importance of representing the problem space. This becomes indispensable
in creating a dynamic network for designers to move among examples,
fostering a see-move-see pattern. This journey, navigating from
theoretical discussions to practical applications, reinforces the role
of design space as a crucial medium for enriching design thinking and
enhancing the reasoning skills of design students in the foundational
stages of their education.

As we draw a framework for the design space concept in the basic design
studio context, the inevitable need arises for its definition as a
combination of problem and solution spaces. However, this reframing not
only highlights forthcoming inquiries but also raises intriguing
questions. How do we create this design space, and on which medium? What
could be the instruments for generating the design space in the context
of basic design studio practices in the age of generative and
computational design? Assuming it would contribute to the process of the
student’s reasoning during the studio procedure; would it be possible
also contribute to the individual processes in the studio collectively?

Various applications could potentially represent the problem and
solution spaces of a basic design studio computationally during the
process. Rule-based systems like shape grammar prove effective in
generating complex forms and patterns, making them suitable for
educational design studio setups. However, their limitations become
evident when design problems lack explicit rules or objectives.
Additionally, they often confine novice designers to a single visual
domain, presenting challenges in reconstructing design problems into a
visual medium through their own interpretation.

In the current state of the art, generative AI models might offer more
potential in our context. These models can generate novel solution
instances by analyzing and synthesizing hidden patterns in diverse data
domains, without requiring a predetermined structure of rules or
algorithms. Text-to-image generative AI models, such as diffusion models
(DM), could efficiently reconstruct and reinterpret the ambiguities of
design problems while representing solutions. The computational
architecture of natural language processing (NLP)-based text-to-image DM
aligns with the assignment-based, learning-by-doing educational model of
the basic design studio.

To conclude, generating a design space that not only represents
combinatoric outputs of solutions but also inherits the given design
problem inputs can aid novice designers in acquiring design reasoning
strategies. The implementation of generative AI holds potential that
have not been fully estimated yet. Imagine the AI model as a
computational peer in the basic design studio, interpreting design
problems faster than the “ants,” iterating a vast set of solutions.
Regardless of the performance of solution alternatives in answering the
design problems given in the briefs, it would expand the solution space
of the basic design studio. With a controlled selection of solution
alternatives for discussion in panel sessions led by design instructors,
individuals can learn by observing a myriad of solutions to the same
problem. Hence, they can move on to their organic solution generation
processes, according to see-move-see pattern,[^8_S3_Cicek_Ozkar_31] guided by the
collective interpretation gained through exposure to the expanded design
space of the basic design studio.
