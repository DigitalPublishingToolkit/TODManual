It is already apparent that the COVID-19 crisis is hitting marginalised
and disadvantaged communities and populations especially hard. This
groundbreaking book trains the spotlight on these social groups,
speaking not simply for or about them, but allowing them a voice. The
authors offer valuable insights into how data activism can generate new
ways of fighting back and achieving visibility.

In the age of Big Data, it is becoming clear that the emerging
algorithmic rationalities that increasingly dominate much of who we are
and what we do continue to be embedded in colonialist onto-epistemic
structures that classify, maim, re-victimize, and make invisible whole
populations, groups and regions. The fact that who counts and what's
counted counts is thus truer than ever before. From migrants and
refugees to slum dwellers, from LGBTQ+ persons and women affected by
domestic violence to marginal communities in the North and the wretched
in the Global Souths, COVID-19 from the Margins caringly and
thoughtfully demonstrates why the multiplicity we call "the poor" is
more than ever at the receiving end of the worst effects of globalized,
patriarchal/colonial racist capitalism. But they are not passive
victims, for their everyday forms of activism and re-existence,
including their daily tweaking of the digital for purposes of community,
care, and survival, has incredible insights about design and digital
justice that this book takes to heart as we strive to undo the lethal
effects of "the first pandemic of the datafied society."

So many lives, so many deaths: this significant work is a spectacular
experiment, bringing widely differing perspectives to bear on the
complex, difficult and novel issues presented by a pandemic that is
transforming our world. Brilliantly experimental in design and
execution, this moving work casts beams of light into the complex,
tragic and global phenomenon that is COVID-19.

*Monroe Price, Senior Associate, Centre for Socio-Legal Studies,
University of Oxford (UK)*

I whole-heartedly endorse this timely and important book which aims to
give voice to silenced groups during the current global COVID-19 crisis.
This book adopts an inclusive approach by gathering hitherto untold
stories from marginalised communities across the world about how the
current pandemic interacts with the complex cycles of poverty and
inequality within which they are embedded. The book is indeed a welcome
antidote to the dominant narrative of managing the pandemic by counting,
measuring and quantifying the costs incurred to mainstream economic
activity. The narratives from the field collated by the authors are not
merely 'stories' but can contribute precious knowledge and policy
stimulus to correct the gross negligence of societies to address
inequalities that exist in wealth, income and power across the world and
accentuated further as a result of COVID-19.

*Shirin Madon, Associate Professor of Information Communication
Technologies and Socio-Economic Development, London School of Economics
and Political Science (UK)*

A timely, thought-provoking intervention that anyone interested in
digital narratives from the COVID-19 era, particularly those emerging
from the Global South, should surely pay attention to. Through this
volume, Stefania Milan, Silvia Masiero and Emiliano Treré have once
again demonstrated why they remain recognized, to-go-to experts on all
things digital.

This book is brought to you by the *Big Data from the South Research
Initiative (BigDataSur)*, which was tasked with decolonizing how we
understand datafication and surveillance. Launched by Stefania Milan and
Emiliano Treré in 2017 in Cartagena de Indias (Colombia), BigDataSur has
brought together researchers, practitioners, and activists to critically
explore the intersections between data, technology, and the plurality of
Souths that constitute our world.

A number of funders have supported our work. This project has received
funding from the European Research Council (ERC), under the European
Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program (grant agreement
No. 639379-DATACTIVE; https://data-activism.net). In addition, the blog
platform *COVID-19 from the Margins* was assisted by the Amsterdam
School of Cultural Analysis (ASCA) at the University of Amsterdam (The
Netherlands), and the School of Journalism, Media and Culture (JOMEC) at
Cardiff University (UK). The book was made possible by funding from the
Research Priority Areas Amsterdam Centre for European Studies (ACES) and
Global Digital Cultures (GDC) at the University of Amsterdam.

We wish to also thank the institutions who did *not* fund this
initiative because it was, for example, "too international"; their lack
of support made us volunteer our time and labour but encouraged us to
endure. We learned that if a project funding line on a topic does not
yet exist, it means that research is sorely needed. 

We are indebted to Geert Lovink and his team of the Institute of Network
Cultures at the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences (The
Netherlands) for enthusiastically supporting this project from the
start. We share their commitment to critical theory and openness. It is
an honour to be able to leave our mark in their edgy "Theory on Demand"
series.

 

We wish to wholeheartedly thank our amazing copy-editors Andrew R.
Schrock from Indelible Voice (English), Nicolás Fuster (Spanish), Sergio
Barbosa (Portuguese), and Giulia Polettini (Chinese). We are grateful to
the outlets that co-published, re-published, or published before us some
of the contributions that appear in this volume, particularly the
independent global media organization *openDemocracy* (with special
thanks to Rosemary Bechler, and Breno Bringel and Geoffrey Pleyers and
their openMovements series). Our gratitude extends also to the members
of the DATACTIVE team who assisted us over these months, especially
Jeroen de Vos, Zhen Ye, Guillén Torres and Yiran Zhao. Special thanks to
Nicolás Fuster, who has been supporting the editorial team since the
inception of the blog. Leontien Kremers, Astrit Blommestijn, and the
leadership teams of Research Priority Areas ACES and GDC at the
University of Amsterdam also deserve a mention.

Finally, we would like to acknowledge and sincerely thank all the
authors who accepted our invitation to share their stories in these
strange and difficult times. Together, we took part in an urgent
experiment to make space, give voice, and lend an ear to the people and
communities that remain at the margins of collective care. While so much
more remains to be done, we are proud of what we accomplished together.

## Introduction: COVID-19 seen from the land of otherwise (Stefania Milan, Emiliano Treré & Silvia Masiero) {#introduction-covid-19-seen-from-the-land-of-otherwise-stefania-milan-emiliano-treré-silvia-masiero .BOOK_Heading-2}

As we enter a new decade of the third millennium, cities have become
"smart," information systems are assumed to be "intelligent," service
work has moved to the "platform," and identities have been made
"digital." Yet, society's technologization and datafication has not
prevented it from falling victim to an unexpected and nasty virus. At
the time of writing, over one million people have lost their lives to
COVID-19. Since the World Health Organisation declared the outbreak of
COVID-19 a pandemic on March 11, 2020, narratives about counting,
measuring, and quantifying the consequences of the virus have dominated
governmental and public discourse. By enumerating and comparing cases
and locations, diffusion rates, victims, and the occupancy of intensive
care units, policymakers and experts have given life to a data-driven
narrative. But something was missing in the first pandemic narrative of
the datafied society; communities at the margins---workers in the
informal economy, victims of domestic violence, low-income families, and
the so-called "Global South"---remained ignored. The disempowered were
denied a voice in the narrative.

 

To ensure they were heard, this book gathered the untold stories of the
pandemic. It started with *COVID-19 from the Margins*, a multilingual
blog launched in May 2020 to empower social groups and individuals
silenced in the mainstream narrative of the pandemic. *COVID-19 from the
Margins* emerged from the *Big Data from the South Initiative* (also
known as BigDataSur), since 2017 actively decolonizing how we understand
datafication and its consequences on a plurality of "Souths."

Drawing on 47 blog posts submitted to *COVID-19 from the Margins*
between May and October 2020, the book features stories of invisibility
and injustice, and hope and resistance. These stories come from
communities with limited statistical capacity, domestic violence
survivors, and indigenous people. Their stories, which had remained on
the fringe of global news reports and relief efforts, found an audience
within these pages. 

 

Our introduction starts by offering three conceptual tenets to help the
reader interpret the stories presented in this book, and the many others
that no single book alone can contain. It then explores the five themes
of the book: human invisibilities and the politics of counting;
perpetuated vulnerabilities and inequalities; datafied social policies;
technological reconfigurations in the datafied pandemic; and pandemic
solidarities and resistance from below. Finally, we illustrate how this
manuscript came to life, since our goal is also to forge distinct
relationships and ways of working together to decolonize knowledge
production. 

 

### Theorising from the Margins: In and Beyond COVID-19  {#theorising-from-the-margins-in-and-beyond-covid-19 .BOOK_Heading-3}

The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed the inadequacy of conceptual
development in multiple disciplines. Sociology, media studies,
informatics, and health sciences have failed to capture the nuances of
harms and vulnerabilities brought about by the first pandemic of the
datafied society. We hope this book, taken as a whole, helps us rethink
our theories and de-Westernize our approaches. We start this process of
rethinking by exploring three concepts that we believe can help us
disentangle the complexities of the present. The first concept is *the
margins,* which captures the multiplicity and diversity of the
communities represented in these pages. The second concept is *data
poverty*, which contextualizes the unusual invisibilities brought about
by the pandemic, intensified by existing vulnerabilities in the global
health crisis. The third concept is the *datafication of anti-poverty
programmes*, which helps us understand the need to include datafied
anti-poverty architectures in the pandemic.

*Data at the Margins*

"\[T\]he margin," maintains Colombian citizen media scholar Clemencia
Rodríguez, is "a shortcut to speak of complex dynamics of power
inequality. Processes of asymmetrical access to material and symbolic
resources shape differentiated and unequal access to the public
sphere".[^1] Drawing on Rodríguez, we situate the margins as complex
sites of struggle where the challenges of datafication unfold in in
different ways from the mainstream, and also where particular data
ecologies and original territories might emerge and thrive. At the
margins, data defy expectations. It is frequently used in ways that
substantially differ from their originally intended purpose, and do not
develop in a predictable manner. Data might even be absent because
people lack the infrastructure or skills needed to produce and share it.
Hence, journeying into data at the margins is "stepping into the land of
otherwise".[^2] This is why we have chosen the powerful conceptual lens
of the margins to gather and amplify the underrepresented and neglected
voices of the datafied society during COVID-19. The margins convey and
make sense of the peripheral nature of the stories presented here,
capturing the significance, resourcefulness, and unexpectedness of their
data-related practices. 

The notion of the margins resonates with the understanding of "the
South" as plural.[^3] Such multiple, overlapping Souths constitute at
the core of the *Big Data from the South Research Initiative*. If we
conceive the South as a multi-layered place of resistance, subversion,
and creativity---rather than merely as a geographical marker---we can
see how "Southern" data practices and revolts contesting oppression can
also be found in the Global North. In the Global North, marginalized and
oppressed groups also fight daily against forms of data injustice to
reclaim their visibility in an increasingly datafied social landscape.
Therefore, reflecting on how data, power and resistance unfold in the
Global South cannot be easily separated from confronting how oppression
and inequality are interwoven with datafication of vulnerable
populations in the Global North.

*Data Poverty *

Only 53% of the world population is now connected to the Internet.[^4]
Technologies of datafication, including Artificial Intelligence, are
still more unevenly distributed. However, in an increasingly datafied
society, reducing the problem to a simple dichotomy between the "Big
Data rich" and the "have nots" would be a mistake.[^5] A new type of
"data poverty" has emerged with the pandemic. Data poverty has to do
with the very same existence of people on the map of concerns. This
oversight occurs because policymakers increasingly rely on "calculated
publics" to make decisions and allocate public resources, such as health
care or vaccines. As a result, peoples' existence is increasingly yoked
to data, as the COVID-19 health crisis has made evident. Being
"datafied" during a pandemic---e.g., visible to the state or to the
surrounding community---might be for many disempowered groups a
*conditio sine qua non* of survival and care; think of undocumented
migrants, low-income families, indigenous peoples, and domestic violence
survivors. While data poverty is exacerbated by fundamental inequalities
that pre-date the datafied society, it is also aggravated by the limited
citizen agency in a complex ecosystem of data extractivism.[^6]

The data poverty we see emerging with COVID-19 cannot be easily
described by other popular critiques of the datafied society, such as
the notion of "data colonialism".[^7] The latter seems to assume that
privacy and data protection---to the extent of being invisible to the
state---are human rights to be protected. However, Couldry and Meijas
"hypostatize a certain 'data universalism,' which represents, at once,
the hermeneutical ground and horizon of the whole discussion".[^8] Data
poverty, instead, demands further situating any analysis of the impact
of datafication in relation to the specific, contingent harms it might
impose on people and communities on the ground.

 

*The Datafication of Anti-poverty Programmes*

Developing our theorisation further, the concepts introduced above could
improve the datafication of anti-poverty programmes, which Masiero and
Das (2019) theorise as the conversion into data of social protection
scheme beneficiaries.[^9] The pandemic generates the new
vulnerabilities, invisibilities, and forms of socio-economic fragility
illustrated in this book. In response, social protection schemes on a
global scale need to respond with new forms of inclusivity that oppose
the restrictive logic of social protection targeting. More broadly, the
datafied social policy responses of COVID-19 need to be globally
inclusive and optimise resources that---as food and entitlement crises
emerging worldwide demonstrate---have become scarce. This scarcity leads
to new trade-offs where the datafication of user populations, rather
than conducive to targeting, needs to generate new forms of inclusion in
social welfare systems.

### COVID-19 From the Margins: Mapping Core Themes {#covid-19-from-the-margins-mapping-core-themes .BOOK_Heading-3}

Many themes have emerged and overlapped in the stories in this book, and
only a thorough read will do justice to their heterogeneity and to rich
specificities. This introduction summarises five core threads that
comprise the organizational structure of the book. By bringing these
threads together, we offer an overview of the topics that we hope
inspires a much-needed discussion about how the world can endure the
long-term consequences of COVID-19.

*Human Invisibilities and the Politics of Counting*

Upon its launch on May 4, 2020, the inaugural piece of the COVID-19 from
the Margins blog identified a widening data divide for communities in
the South. Multiple contributions explored how disease surveillance in
the pandemic determined invisibility, raising concerns about the extent
to which a just data management is being applied to populations. As
these questions became increasingly raised during the crisis, data
visualization gained important implications for data management. Authors
in this book expand on privacy and surveillance concerns raised by
COVID-19 tracking apps. Problematizations of app-based surveillance in
the margins are driven by ongoing discussions of data justice[^10],
highlighting how such issues intersect with the stories of invisibility
and marginalisation throughout this book. 

 

*Perpetuated Vulnerabilities and Inequalities*

This book's contributors have illuminated perpetuated vulnerabilities
that have affected a variety of communities during the COVID-19
emergency. Discussing the struggles experienced by the LGBTQ+ community,
one of the chapters notes that, as "stay at home" becomes the new
normal, ingrained societal prejudice may result in LGBTQ+ people not
having a home to stay in. Diverse contributions of workers in the gig
economy note the continued uncertainty under COVID-19, which leaves them
unable to hold public and private entities accountable for health and
economic risks under the pandemic. In times of crisis and vulnerability,
victims of pre-existing oppression---femicide, domestic violence
survivors, and migrants---suffer a twofold burden. In this light,
narratives of heightened vulnerability under the pandemic become
crucial, since they highlight situations that require interventions that
recognise pre-existing conditions and their extremisation. The
perpetuation of inequalities under the pandemic thus reinforces the need
for response measures that redistribute access to services and
resources.

 

*Datafied Social Policies*

As national lockdowns took hold of civil societies worldwide during
COVID-19, vulnerable groups have been disproportionately affected by the
crisis. Stories collected in this book highlight the importance of
social policies in emergency response, as well as consequences of
datafication on such policies. While portraying different country cases,
these narratives have at least two common themes. First, these stories
make the point that information on who is entitled to emergency
assistance and to what degree is vital to devising social protection
policy. Datafication reifies the way existing entitlements are
determined. In the cases of narrow targeting, datafication exposes the
consequences of making social assistance conditional on strict
entitlement criteria.

 

A second policy theme in this book is that the COVID-19 crisis has
exacerbated the consequences of making social welfare conditional on
digital identity. In India, security concerns have emerged around how
the national contact-tracing app builds on a pre-existing ecosystem of
digital identity based on Aadhaar (the largest biometric database
worldwide). The use of biometrics as a means to combat inclusion errors
rather than wrongful exclusions has banned access for the unentitled,
without assuring access or affording data justice to the wrongfully
excluded. On a global scale, the reshuffled priorities of the COVID-19
emergency powerfully illustrate biometric issues, drawing into question
the ethics of targeting and its impact on social assistance programs.

*Technological Reconfigurations in the Datafied Pandemic*

Existing technologies have been repurposed during the pandemic, and
narratives in this book highlight multiple impacts that these
reconfigurations have had on the margins. In the pandemic, social media
platforms have been repurposed to promote new forms of collective
action. Data policies have required the provision of additional
safeguards due to marginalized communities being vulnerable to unfair
data treatment. This problem has become more acute in contexts that lack
data protection policies, or where data policies are not enforced. In
extreme cases, such as national contexts where pandemic denial magnifies
the problem, open data emerges as a safeguard against the
vulnerabilities of marginalized communities.

*Pandemic Solidarities and Resistance From Below*

Stories throughout this book explore the intersection of technology and
political power. These narratives provoke questions around the
importance of resistance "from below" during the pandemic. To appraise
the perpetuation of vulnerabilities under the pandemic, understanding
the affordances of digital platforms to give voice to excluded people is
crucial. Accordingly, authors interrogate platforms' affordances to
provide information to and support vulnerable groups during the crisis.
Equally important is the role of data visualisation in enabling
solidarity-making, especially when data on groups at the margins, such
as victims of domestic violence, lack proper representation. Crucially,
the emergence of new forms of technology-mediated solidarity can be seen
in the stories unfolding through digital platforms and narrated in this
book. New modes of action, such as citizen sensing, have emerged in the
datafied society, generating important questions about the implications
of such practices under COVID-19. The fifth theme in the book brings
these ideas together, establishing continuity between visualisation,
solidarity, and protest, and how they intertwine in situations of
crisis.

 

### A Note on Process {#a-note-on-process .BOOK_Heading-3}

This book is special in three ways. First, it is a much-needed
multilingual conversation. We wanted to acknowledge and celebrate
linguistic and cultural diversity within its page. Seeking diversity
drove us to open space and give voice for different ways people express
themselves through distinct epistemologies, ontologies, and worldviews.
Linguists have long recognized that a language is much more than just a
system of conventional signs to refer to the physical reality around us.
Rather, language enforces a certain cognitive view of the world. As
such, allowing people from different corners of the globe to pick their
preferred language to join the conversation helped readers understand
their unique perspective on the world. At the same time, language
represents a way to practice "epistemic disobedience" and question the
primacy of the Euro/Western-centric episteme[^11], and de-center
dominant ways of being and knowing.[^12] In a recent article, Ana
Cristina Suzina called out English as the *lingua franca* of the
academic debate as "an additional barrier to achieving more equitable
participation and a diversity of perspectives in scientific
publications" and "a filter that strongly limits the encounters between
Western theory and scientific cultures rooted in other languages".[^13]

This book wants to lead the way towards multicultural encounters, in a
historical moment when the first global disease of the datafied society
keeps being reported from Western-centric angles. We hope this book
gives voice to a "pluriverse" in the making, as anthropologist Arturo
Escobar describes a world "where many worlds fit".[^14] In a pluriverse,
we are free to reimagine and reconstruct local worlds that would
otherwise be invisible. But there is a second motivation we had to write
a multilingual book. We wanted to make readers experience first-hand
what individuals and communities at the margins undergo on a regular
basis: discomfort. Marginalized communities are forced to read texts in
a language that reflects a worldview that is not their own. Each book
chapter published in the authors' original language includes an abstract
in English, but it is the responsibility of the reader to find a way
around and forward. We hope readers are driven by a passion to learn and
explore to go beyond the inevitable initial discomfort.

 

Second, this book's novel format embraces the twisted time of the
pandemic. It does not try to flatten or universalize the narrative, and
instead traces the impact of the pandemic on the margins as the virus
spread across the world. The contributions, initially meant for the web
and crafted with a popular audience in mind, were written between May
and October 2020. For this reason, they bundle phases of the pandemic
into an "instant history" that speaks of fear and uncertainty, but also
addresses hope and collective organizing as they coalesced in the
grassroots response to the virus. We deliberately decided not to update
the texts, nor to indicate when they were first published. The reader is
left to navigate the stories, embrace or reject the experiences
recounted in the distinct chapters, and be inspired. This plurality of
stories reflects the accelerated yet abnormal times of the pandemic
itself, since different regions and communities were hit at different
times and through different modalities. Because "second waves" are
coming back to haunt us and no vaccine is currently in sight, our book
is not the final word about COVID-19. As "history in the making," the
pandemic demands a reading experience that helps us creatively
disentangle complexity while providing inspiration for proactively
engaging with it.

Finally, this book is special because it crafts a distinct type of
conversation that nurtures a community of practice. To start with,
researchers enter into a productive dialogue with activists,
practitioners, and communities on the ground, offering timely, critical
reflections in near-real time and in an accessible language. Second, our
focus in this book is on stories and experiences, rather than on the
classic criteria germane to judging the worth of academic publications,
like seniority and reputation. For example, this book has allowed many
junior authors---most of them coming from the peripheries of mainstream
academia---to reclaim their voice and their situated experience. In
practice, we broke down elitist academic barriers by allocating funding
for honorariums to pay contributors in need, and by providing editorial
support to help individuals with less writing experience to edit their
contributions.

Unfortunately, no matter how special, this book only tells a small
number of the many stories of vulnerability, suffering, and hope that
deserve a global audience. Our over 70 authors were self-selected, and
enthusiastically responded to our invitation to put their writing into
stories. Many more, however, were so badly affected by the pandemic and
its socio-economic consequences that they were not able to join the
conversation. Numerous vulnerable communities are still
under-represented; think of small island communities, disabled people,
and care workers. As editors, our framing of their writing also reflects
our own perspectives. We have been part of many conversations, but we
are still also situated, meaning how we write about these stories still
reflects our biases. Nonetheless, we offer this work-in-progress to
shape "alternative networks of knowledge"[^15] capable of
"dewesternalizing" our collective thinking.[^16] 

**Looking Forward**

As the world encounters the long-term consequences of COVID-19, more
vulnerabilities will likely emerge for the communities in this book, and
for the many more communities we were not able to include. In this
rapidly evolving scenario, this book---still a work in progress---offers
a way to make sense of the harms of the first pandemic of the datafied
society. We hope it offers an initial important step to open space for
the multiple untold stories of COVID-19 from the margins that have yet
to be narrated, amplified, and circulated. This is why this book ends by
inviting you, as readers, to share and amplify these global,
invisibilized, multilingual narratives of the pandemic from and within
the Global Souths.

# Theme I. Human Invisibilities and the Politics of Counting {#theme-i.-human-invisibilities-and-the-politics-of-counting .BOOK_Heading-1}

## A Widening Data Divide: COVID-19 and the Global South (Stefania Milan & Emiliano Treré) {#a-widening-data-divide-covid-19-and-the-global-south-stefania-milan-emiliano-treré .BOOK_Heading-2}

The COVID-19 pandemic is sweeping the world. First identified in
mainland China in December 2019, it rapidly spread worldwide, making
Antarctica the only "corona-free" continent. News reports globally are
filled with numbers and figures about testing. We count tests, follow
the rise of positive results, and mourn the dead by looking at the daily
tolls. These numbers are deeply shaped by socio-economic and political
geography; the virus follows distinct diffusion curves, and countries
and institutions count cases differently. These numbers exist in both
state policies and people's imaginaries, and affect our ability to care,
share empathy, and donate to relief efforts. They are the conditions of
existence of the problem, and place a country on a global map of
concerns. Yet most countries from the so-called Global South are absent
from the number-based narration of the pandemic. Why are they missing,
and with what consequences?

### Data Availability and Statistical Capacity in Developing Countries {#data-availability-and-statistical-capacity-in-developing-countries .BOOK_Heading-3}

If numbers are the conditions of existence of the COVID-19 problem, we
ought to pay attention to the (in)ability of many countries in the South
to test their population for the virus and produce reliable population
statistics---let alone adequately care for them. Countries struggle with
a "data gap" as well as of data quality. Even in "normal" times, such
data issues hinder "evidence-based policy making, tracking progress and
development, and increasing government accountability".[^17] While the
World Health Organization issues warnings about the "dramatic situation"
concerning the spread of COVID-19 in the African continent (to name just
one of the blind spots of our datasets of the global pandemic), the
World Economic Forum calls for "flattening the curve" in developing
countries.[^18] Progress has been made following the revision of the
United Nations' Millennium Development Goals in 2005, when countries in
the Global South were invited to devise National Strategies for the
Development of Statistics. Yet, a cursory look at the NYU GovLab's
valuable repository of "data collaboratives"[^19] addressing the
COVID-19 pandemic reveals an absence of data collection and monitoring
projects South of the hemisphere. The dearth of Southern data lulls us
into believing that "no data = no problem."

### Disease and "Whiteness" {#disease-and-whiteness .BOOK_Heading-3}

Epidemiology and pharmacogenetics (i.e., the study of the genetic basis
of how people respond to pharmaceuticals) are largely based on the
"inclusion of white/Caucasians in studies and the exclusion of other
ethnic groups".[^20] In other words, modeling disease evolution and
related solutions are based on datasets primarily account for the
Caucasian population. This is a known problem in the field, which
derives from the "assumption that a Black person could be thought of as
being White," dismisses specificities and differences. This problem has
been linked to the "lack of social theory development, due mainly to the
reluctance of epidemiologists to think about social mechanisms (e.g.,
racial exploitation)".[^21] While COVID-19 represents a slight variation
on this trend---having been first identified in China---the large-scale
problem remains. A global health emergency like COVID-19 risks
reinforcing and perpetuating racist differentials of whiteness through
data.[^22]

### A Ripe Market for the Industry {#a-ripe-market-for-the-industry .BOOK_Heading-3}

The developing world's lack of national testing capacity might fall prey
to two booming industries: genetic and disease testing, and
telecom-enabled population monitoring. Private companies might be able
to fill the gap left by the state, mapping populations at risk while
monetizing their data. The case of *23andme*[^23] is symptomatic of the
rise of industry-led testing, which constitutes a double-edge sword. On
the one hand, private actors might supply key services that
resource-poor or failing states are unable to provide. On the other
hand, the distorted, hidden agendas of profit-led players reveal their
shortcomings and dangers. If we look at the telecom industry, we can see
how it has contributed to track disease propagation in health
emergencies such as Ebola.[^24] The global open data community has
called for[^25] smoother data exchange between the private and the
public sector to collectively address the spread of the virus. However,
in the absence of adequate regulatory frameworks for privacy and data
retention in the Global South, local authorities might fall prey to
dubious outside interventions.

### The Populism and Racism Factors {#the-populism-and-racism-factors .BOOK_Heading-3}

The lack of reliable numbers to accurately portray the COVID-19 pandemic
as it spreads to the Southern hemisphere also offers fertile ground for
malicious actors to promote distorted narratives for political reasons.
The dearth of data allows populist leaders like Brazil's Jair Bolsonaro
to announce the "return to normality" in the country, dismissing the
harsh reality as a collective "hysteria." In Italy, the "fake news" that
migrant populations of African origin would be "immune" to the disease
swept social media, unleashing racist comments and anti-migrant calls
for action.[^26] While the same rumor has been circulating on the
African continent[^27] and populism has been hitting Western democracies
hard, it might be have more dramatic consequences in the more populous
countries of the South. In Mexico, left-wing populist president Andrés
Manuel López Obrador responded to the coronavirus emergency by insisting
that Mexicans should "keep living life as usual.\"[^28] He did not stop
his tour in the south of the country and frequently contradicted the
advice of public health officials. Obrador repeatedly ignored social
distancing by touching, hugging, and kissing his supporters---going as
far as to say that he considered the pandemic to be a plot to derail his
presidency. These dangerous comments, assumptions and attitudes are a
by-product of the lack of reliable data and testing that we explore in
this essay.

### The Risk of Universalising the Problem {#the-risk-of-universalising-the-problem .BOOK_Heading-3}

Luckily, the experience and harsh familiarity of various countries from
the Global South[^29] to in cope with disasters, catastrophes, and
emergencies has prompted them to deploy containment measures more
quickly than many countries in the Global North. The lack of reliable
data from the South, however, will make modelling the diffusion of the
disease difficult. The temptation will likely be to import models and
appropriate predictions from other countries and socio-economic
realities, and then base domestic measures and policies on them.
"Universalizing" the problem as well as the solutions, as we warned in a
2019 article[^30], is tempting, especially in these times of global
uncertainty. Universalizing entails erroneously thinking that a problem
manifests itself in exactly the same manner everywhere, disregarding
local features. Coupled with the "whiteness" observed earlier,
universalising gives rise to an explosive cocktail that is likely to
create more problems than it solves. 

### Beyond the Blind Spot? {#beyond-the-blind-spot .BOOK_Heading-3}

While many have enough to worry about "at home," the largest portion of
the world population today resides in the so-called Global South, with
all the concrete challenges of their situation. For instance, for a good
portion of the 1,3 billion Indian citizens now on lockdown, staying at
home might mean starving.[^31] How can the global community of open data
experts, researchers, life science scholars, and digital rights
activists help "fix" the widening data divide that risks severely
weakening any local effort to curb the expansion of COVID-19 to
populations already at the margins? We argue that the question is not
simply whether we pump in the much-needed resources, or how we
collaborate. The question is where we decide to look? COVID-19 will make
apparent the need for a global alliance of diverse experts who, jointly
with civil society organizations, can fast-track the capacity-building
of developing countries involved with counting.

## COVID-19 Pandemic and Biopolitics in Latin America (Silvio Waisbord & María Soledad Segura) {#covid-19-pandemic-and-biopolitics-in-latin-america-silvio-waisbord-maría-soledad-segura .BOOK_Heading-2}

As the first pandemic in the datafied society, COVID-19 offers an
opportunity to reassess debates about digital communication and
governability. These debates are driven by an interest in understanding
particular aspects of "digital biopolitics"---the ambitious efforts by
governments and corporations to maximize knowledge and control of
populations for political and economic power. Digital biopolitics also
draws into question the vulnerability of democratic rights such as
privacy and the "right to know." In a recent article, Stefan Ecks
concludes that, "we have never seen biopolitics on such a scale. 2020 is
the birth year of radical biopolitics.[^32]

Given our longstanding interest in the datafied society in Latin
America, we are interested in assessing the applicability of arguments
about contemporary biopolitics in Europe and the United States. Even if
it is too early to draw categorical conclusions, given that the
evolution and aftermath of the pandemic are unpredictable, there are
indications that the current situation in the region does not match
recent conclusions about the escalation of biopolitics. Various factors
shape biopolitics, such as government objectives; bureaucratic systems;
accountability and transparency of mechanisms and policies; the
reliability of digital platforms; and conditions of epidemiological
surveillance. None of these factors in Latin America are comparable to
the situation in most countries in the global North.

At the time of this writing, Latin America has become the new epicenter
of the pandemic, based on an increase in reported cases of infections
and deaths.[^33] Various governments in Latin America (Perú, Argentina,
Bolivia, Chile, Ecuador, México, Colombia and Brasil) and the
Inter-American Development Bank have deployed digital technologies to
control the transmission of the virus and support testing and tracing.
They have collaborated with private companies and universities to set up
mobile applications for geolocalizing and contact-tracing possibly
infected people. Expectedly, these actions have raised concerns about
the negative impact of massive surveillance.

While we recognize the legitimacy of these concerns, the problem in
Latin America has taken on different dimensions than similar efforts in
Europe, North America, and East Asia. For the moment, the governments in
the region have encountered significant problems launching and
maintaining massive digital surveillance apparatuses. What stands in the
way of pandemic-driven biopolitics is not a firm official commitment to
protecting personal data or balancing public health objectives and
democratic rights. Rather, the obstacles are technological and
institutional: poor reach and limited effectiveness of digital and
mobile technologies, as well as the inability of the Latin American
state to govern and provision health services.

Most national health systems suffer from chronic deficits in
provisioning services and monitoring populations. These deficits have
been driven by a lack of funding and effective government administrative
systems to set up, conduct, and maintain monitoring of health data and
personal data. Underreported health data is common; in countries such as
Nicaragua, Perú and Venezuela, health authorities have not even bothered
to report basic epidemiological data. As a result, underreporting of
cases is widely suspected. It is hard to imagine that malnourished
health systems, when combined with other government agencies, would
result in well-lubricated apparatuses. Take, for example, the decision
by Brazil's President Jair Bolsonaro to terminate the agreement between
telecommunications companies and the Ministry of Science, Technology,
Innovation and Communication to provide information on mobile phones
related to geographic location and mobilization. The decision to
terminate was driven more by Bolsonaro's reckless pandemic policy than
concerns about data protection. His government has had an appalling
performance since the beginning of the pandemic, and has flatly
dismissed concerns raised by health experts (including his former
Ministry of Health Nelson Teich) and the World Health Organization.

Official disinterest in mobilizing digital technologies to control the
pandemic pales in comparison to the way that police, military and
intelligence services in the region historically approach communication
and information technologies for securitization. From the early decades
of the twentieth century until recent military dictatorships and
contemporary democracies, governments have developed surveillance
technologies to control populations, often with support from foreign
countries. Recently, governments in countries including Colombia,
Mexico, and Guatemala have beefed up surveillance technologies[^34] to
spy on critics including human rights activists, politicians and
journalists. Nowhere in the region did national governments show
comparable interest in incorporating digital technologies to maximize
biopolitics. These national differences reflect distinct priorities and
approaches to surveillance and population management.

Digital technologies do not improve outcomes without a high rate of
adoption of contact tracing and geo-localization mobile applications.
Technology's usefulness to controlling the pandemic would be quite
limited due to the restricted availability of high-end cell phone
equipment with Bluetooth and GPS and the unequal infrastructure of cell
coverage in the region. An effective digital system would also require
relatively updated mobile phones, which is rare, as civil society
organizations such as *Derechos Digitales*[^35] and *Fundación
Sadosky*[^36] have observed. According to 2010 data, between 65 % and 85
% of households own mobile phones in Latin American countries, except
for Cuba and Venezuela, where numbers are lower.[^37] Mobile phone
services in many countries, such as Mexico, Argentina, Brazil, Colombia
and Venezuela, have received frequent complaints for poor quality,
according to consumer rights protection associations.[^38]

Other technological barriers to tracing effectiveness include battery
power and memory space, which current mobile health applications rely
on. Apple and Google, the two largest providers of operating systems for
cell phones, joined forces to address this issue. Nonetheless, it is not
yet clear whether digital corporations will make certain applications
available in older mobile phones that are more common in the region.
Application malfunctions during the somewhat chaotic launch of COVID-19
in several countries have discouraged people from using them. Due to
poor design, applications have also had many vulnerabilities. This was
the case in Argentina in the province of San Luis, where national
identity documents---including the processing code that is an
authentication factor and the photo---were leaked. In Buenos Aires, it
is possible to access the date of birth and address of any citizen.

In summary, the pandemic has prompted state-directed plans for
monitoring COVID-19 prevalence in partnership with digital corporations
and universities. The scope of the disease requires collecting massive
amounts of data on populations, improving reporting systems, and
deploying state-of-the-art technologies. However, it is not clear that
these plans would achieve desired results. The obstacle is not a strong
culture of privacy and data protection, but rather chronic problems
among government agencies to ensure that health systems have ample and
quality coverage, coupled with a weak and uneven commitment to
addressing the pandemic. Government commitment has been notoriously
lacking in Latin American health systems. In countries with serious
infrastructure problems and inadequate funding for health services, it
would have been surprising if governments had actively promoted data
tracking to inform healthcare research and policy and fix intractable
problems. Indeed, the spotty record of health systems in the region in
responding to dengue, zika, chagas and other infectious disease
outbreaks in recent years suggests that government negligence and
lethargy are not conducive to deploying massive digital monitoring
interventions.[^39] Biopolitics assumes the willingness of states to
know and roll out systems to track and control populations. On health
matters, Latin American states have largely lacked the political will as
well as human, economic and technical resources to know and act.

## European Stereotypes in Times of COVID-19: The 'Frugal Four' and the 'Irresponsible South' (Luiza Bialasiewicz) {#european-stereotypes-in-times-of-covid-19-the-frugal-four-and-the-irresponsible-south-luiza-bialasiewicz .BOOK_Heading-2}

The on-going debates regarding the coronavirus Recovery Fund that will
form the focus of discussions at the upcoming EU summit on July 17, 2020
have highlighted the pernicious persistence of national stereotypes that
continue to afflict political positioning and decision-making within the
Union. It would be easy to dismiss such stereotypes simply as an easy
short-hand adopted by politicians to position themselves within EU
political debates. Self- and other- stereotypes also play very well to
domestic audiences, providing an easy set of representations to draw
from when arguing for a national position, both vis-a-vis Brussels or
other EU member states.

The self-ascribed moniker "the frugal four" adopted by Austria, Denmark,
the Netherlands and Sweden is no exception. Intended to mark out these
countries' opposition to "irresponsible" and "excessive" spending of the
proposed EU-wide Recovery Fund, it speaks to moral and economic
positionings. Indeed, the term "moral hazard" wielded by Dutch
politicians in 2012 when a previous proposal for mutualizing European
debt was raise has once more appeared on the scene. Today, we remain
tied to a distinct geographical imagination of hazard, irresponsibility,
and excess. We must take such monikers seriously, because they tell us
about radically different views across EU countries about the roles and
responsibilities of the national state towards its citizenry, their
responsibilities to Europe and fellow Europeans.

### Moral Geographies {#moral-geographies .BOOK_Heading-3}

Italy and the Netherlands offer the most striking example of a "clash of
stereotypes." In recent months, Dutch PM Mark Rutte has taken on the
role of the most vocal leader of the "frugal four." Rutte has threatened
to block recovery funding to Italy and other (mostly southern European)
states if these do not undertake a comprehensive package of reforms.
With this positioning, Rutte and his Finance Minister Wopke Hoekstra
maintain a long-standing self-representation of the Netherlands'
position in the EU as an economically "thrifty" (if not directly
self-serving) actor; the leading government think tank Clingendael
described perceptions of Dutch interest promotion within the EU as
"effective without empathy" in a report published in the spring of
2019.[^40] Beyond re-playing long-standing self-stereotypes within EU
institutions, Rutte is also singing a familiar tune to a home audience
conscious of the parliamentary elections that await him in the coming
year. When Italian PM Giuseppe Conte arrived in The Hague this past week
for a meeting with Rutte, he was greeted outside of the Parliament by
far-right leader Geert Wilders, who raised a sign reading, "Not a cent
for Italy."[^41]

Fig. 1. "Not a Cent for Italy" (Source: Twitter).

Wilders may represent an extreme wing of Dutch nationalist politics, but
the same slogan was featured just a month earlier on the front cover of
Dutch popular weekly *Elsevier Weekblad*. It was accompanied by an
illustration that summed up the competing stereotypes: at the top were
two industrious Dutch workers, and below, two supposed "Mediterranean
types" lounging in the sun. The cover caused a popular uproar in Italy.
Curiously, it was Giorgia Meloni, the leader of the right-nationalist
*Fratelli d'Italia* party that allied with Wilders for the 2019 European
Parliament elections, who filed a formal complaint. He demanded that the
government exact an immediate apology from the Dutch ambassador to
Rome.[^42] "The cover is repugnant" she said, noting the cover depicted
Italians and Mediterraneans as "parasites." "We don't accept lessons
from Holland which has created a tax haven in Europe and is draining
resources from all other Member States," she added.[^43] Other southern
European opinion makers reacted, many in jest. In a tweet from *El País*
Brussels correspondent Bernardo de Miguel, a Portuguese re-working of
the image depicted fat and sunburned Northern European tourists lounging
at the bottom of the image instead:

Fig. 2. "No Lessons from The Netherlands" (Source: Twitter)

Guy Verhofstadt, Belgian MEP and chair of the Alliance of Liberals and
Democrats for Europe, was even stronger in his criticisms. He tweeted
that 'this sort of false reporting led to Brexit," noting that under the
terms of the plan "not 1 NL citizen will pay 1 euro more to the COVID-19
Recovery Fund." *Elsevier Weekblad* simply discounted the protests with
a headline noting "Neo-Fascist *Fratelli d'Italia* demands apologies."

### The Still-Authoritarian South {#the-still-authoritarian-south .BOOK_Heading-3}

Notwithstanding the accurate descriptor (*Fratelli d'Italia* is, indeed,
the direct heir to the "post" Fascist *Alleanza Nazionale* party), this
choice of terminology also offered the Dutch weekly yet another easy
stereotype: the Southern European authoritarian. Along with the
spendthrift image, the stereotype of the (still) authoritarian Southern
Europeans, whether Italian, Spanish or Greek, was another powerful trope
that circulated throughout the lockdown. It was not even a particularly
implicit one; in his weekly televised addresses to Dutch citizens in the
early weeks of the Netherlands' so-called "intelligent lockdown," PM
Rutte insisted on the differences in "national character" that would
make the harsh measures adopted in Southern European countries
impossible in the Netherlands. He suggested that Dutch citizens would
simply not accept the sort of limitations on their personal freedoms
imposed in Italy and Spain.

The choice to adopt only a very limited set of restrictions was a risky
one. In the first months of the "intelligent lockdown," the Netherlands
had one of the highest European mortality rates from the virus. The
government position also initially insisted on the need to "build up
population immunity" though with the rapid debunking of the UK's "herd
immunity" approach. Anna Holligan, writing for BBC News noted in her
report on the scientifically-questionable Dutch strategy, noted that
notion was "rapidly repackaged as a useful by-product rather than the
main goal."[^44] The country had one of the lowest COVID-19 testing
rates in Europe, and it was not until the start of June that testing
became available to the general population: a convenient way to "keep
the numbers down."

To justify limited state intervention into public health measures, Rutte
repeatedly described the Netherlands in his weekly addresses as a
"grown-up country." As he noted in one speech, "what I hear around me,
is that people are glad that they are treated as adults, not as
children." The implication was that the Dutch did not need to be treated
like children "to behave responsibly," unlike other European
citizenries.

### Irresponsible Children {#irresponsible-children .BOOK_Heading-3}

The paternalism at work in the imagined geographies of Europe is not
new. Very similar imaginations were at play during and following the
2008 financial crisis, which had profoundly unequal consequences across
the European space. As Greek economic geographer Costis Hadjimichalis
has argued, to properly understand the geographies of uneven development
in the EU, we need to appreciate their founding "economic mythologies"
that continue to frame popular imaginations of political-economic
choices and outcomes in Europe's North and South.[^45] Disparaging
geographical metaphors like "Club Med" and the infamous "PIIGS"
(Portugal, Italy, Ireland, Greece and Spain) are examples of economic
mythologies in the post-2008 years. The tropes of childishness and
irresponsibility applied to Southern European countries like Italy,
Spain, and Greece today thus draw on a longer-standing set of
imaginations. They trace a direct line from the financial crisis to the
COVID-19 crisis. So too do the prescriptions offered; self-reliance and
individual responsibility are hallmarks of neoliberal capitalism.

### "Italians Must Learn to Make it on Their Own"  {#italians-must-learn-to-make-it-on-their-own .BOOK_Heading-3}

In a front-page interview in the Italian newspaper Corriere della
Sera in the first week of July, 2020, Dutch PM Rutte outlined his
country's position on the Recovery Fund. "Dear Italy, learn to make it
on your own" the headline announced.[^46] In the interview, the first
given by Rutte to an international newspaper since the start of the
pandemic, the PM was direct in his assessment: European solidarity at
this moment was important, of course, but so too was "national
responsibility." Rutte noted that "this means that Member States that
require and request assistance right now must do what is necessary to be
able to face a future crisis of this sort on their own, in resilient
fashion."

His prescription included "measures that will not be popular," including
"reforms that should increase the productivity and competitiveness of
Italy" and the "sustainability of public finances," along with
"promoting fiscal integrity and transparency." The irony of the head of
the Netherlands---widely considered to be one of the least transparent
corporate tax havens--- calling for more "fiscal integrity and
transparency" was not lost on the *Corriere* interviewer. It is not just
a question of competing economic visions at play here, however. As
Alexander de Croo, Belgium's Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of
Finance, wrote in an editorial published on politico.eu in
mid-June,[^47] the battle over the Recovery Fund was not simply an
economic one, regarding whether or not to create debt. It was "an
existential one."

The European project faced nothing less than a battle for the future. As
de Croo wrote, it was time "to break free from the narrative of the
'lazy' south and the 'hard-working' north," since "when it comes to the
economic impact of the coronavirus we are all in the same boat." De
Croo's words were echoed just last week by Angela Merkel in the extended
interview[^48] she gave to a group of European newspapers, as Germany
took up the rotating presidency of the European Council.

In discussing proposals for the Recovery Fund, Merkel rejected the idea
that the Fund was a "major concession to the southern countries." She
replied, "I don't find it helpful to talk about *the* northern
countries, *the* southern countries and *the* eastern Europeans. That is
seeing things in black and white. I expect each of us always to put
ourselves in the other person's shoes and consider problems from the
other's point of view." Keeping in mind "the huge burden in economic,
medical and, of course, because of the many lives lost, emotional terms"
faced by countries like Italy and Spain, she said it was "only right for
Germany to think not just about itself but to be prepared to engage in
an extraordinary act of solidarity."

The Recovery Fund proposal, originally advanced by Merkel and French
President Emmanuel Macron, is indeed about much more than keeping the EU
economy afloat. It elicits a much broader existential question regarding
who Europe is "for." As with all existential questions, the symbols,
metaphors, and stereotypes that inscribe it matter greatly. Is the EU
little more than a free-trade area, where every state can advance its
own particular interests, if need be, at a cost to others? Or should it
be an autonomous and supranational political actor, able to collectively
make political decisions? In a moment when the well-being of all
Europeans is at stake, the choices made at Friday's summit will have
much wider consequences.

## The Trouble of Visualizing COVID-19 During a Nation-wide Lockdown in South Africa (Adriaan Odendaal) {#the-trouble-of-visualizing-covid-19-during-a-nation-wide-lockdown-in-south-africa-adriaan-odendaal .BOOK_Heading-2}

As of October 3, 2020, according to BBC News' interactive COVID-19 data
visualization widget, the continent of Africa had 1,506,015 confirmed
cases of COVID-19 and 36,288 confirmed COVID-19 related deaths.[^49] It
drew data from Johns Hopkins University and unspecified "national public
health agencies." My home country, South Africa (SA), accounts for
677,833 of these confirmed cases and 16,909 of the respective
deaths---just below half of the continent's cases of infections and
deaths. I compared South Africa to the Netherlands next, having moved to
Rotterdam just over a year ago. I opened the Google interactive map that
appears whenever you search for anything COVID-19 related.[^50] I'm not
the only one who developed an obsession with these interactive atlases
of blue bubbles found everywhere from news websites to the World Health
Organization (WHO) homepage.[^51] Being obsessed with data had become
the big-data equivalent of so-called "doom-scrolling."[^52] Yet, the
ease with which I navigated this statistical information to get an
instantaneous aestheticized overview obscured the local labor and
material contexts that went into supplying the data from countries such
as South Africa.

### The Early COVID-days in South Africa {#the-early-covid-days-in-south-africa .BOOK_Heading-3}

The first case of COVID-19 in South Africa was confirmed on Thursday the
5th of March by the National Institute for Communicable Diseases
(NICD).[^53] While I watched the digital blue circles blooming
exponentially in the Netherlands throughout March, initially South
Africa seemed spared. Africa remained relatively unblemished, only a
constellation of small blue pin-pricks. Trying to prevent the eventual
outbreak, South Africa went into a strict lockdown on March 23, 2020 and
the hashtag
[\#LockdownSA](https://twitter.com/hashtag/LockdownSA?src=hashtag_click)
started trending to detail all the tribulations of daily life under a
quasi-militarized quarantine. Shortly before the lockdown, a small
Johannesburg-based data journalism team called Media Hack Collective
(MHC)[^54] decided to launch its own South African COVID-19
data-visualization dashboard.[^55] The dashboard followed the
organization's core tenet of making data available to the general public
in an accessible and understandable format. It tracked cases per
province with a detailed breakdown of travel histories, location, age,
and gender. Due to a lack of timely and effectively communicated
official information during the early outbreaks, the dashboard became
instantly popular.

### Media Diaries -- Episode 2 {#media-diaries-episode-2 .BOOK_Heading-3}

Despite having moved to Rotterdam, I continued working remotely for a
social-impact podcasting company based in Johannesburg called Volume.
During \#LockdownSA one of our regular partners, the South African Media
Innovation Programme[^56], contracted us to produce a show called [Media
Diaries](https://www.volume.africa/media-diaries).[^57] This podcast was
about the daily occupational struggles of journalists reporting on the
COVID-19 crisis during the national lockdown, and sourced stories
through voice-notes. The show's premise was an intriguing paradox: "What
happens when our journalists, the people we expect to be out in the
world for us, are forced to stay at home?" The frustrations traditional
journalists faced were easy to understand. The perspective of data
journalists unable to do their work during lockdown was quite different,
and showed something often ignored in discussions of data reporting. In
the second episode of Media Diaries, we followed the struggles of MHC in
maintaining their COVID-19 dashboard.

### An Obstructed Flow of COVID-19 Data {#an-obstructed-flow-of-covid-19-data .BOOK_Heading-3}

MHC, led by award-winning journalists Alastair Otter and Laura Grant,
launched their COVID-19 dashboard in mid-March to a phenomenal response.
"We had upwards of 300 people looking at the dashboard at any given
time," says Alastair in one of the voice-notes sent to our producers.
Their approach to COVID-19 reporting was to circumvent sensationalist
journalism and misinformation by taking "hard solid data" and releasing
it to the public in a form that was "understandable and usable."
Achieving this goal meant using only authoritative data provided by the
South African Department of Health and the NICD.

When Laura sent her first voice-notes at a later stage, she sounded more
distressed. "It started off with this amazing flow of information from
the NICD," she said. "They would put it on their website every day. Now
the last time they put anything on their website was... three days ago."
The floor of initial public support for project became interspersed with
concerned emails. "It's not really our fault," Laura had to explain,
"The official info is just not coming through."

Shortly after launching their COVID dashboard, MHC partnered with the
Bhekisisa Centre for Health Journalism to assist with the collection of
reliable data.[^58] The Bhekisisa Centre sent press releases from the
Department of Health to MHC, who would use the printed information to
provisionally update their dashboard. The trickle-down data they had to
work with necessitated a complete rework of their dashboard. "Earlier
this morning we heard there were 709 confirmed infections in South
Africa," Alastair said when checking in with our team, "but beyond that
number, there was very little data available." The data that was coming
through was one-dimensional. "We initially started off when the first
few cases of corona-virus were announced the Department of Health and
NICD put out very detailed information about the ages of people, their
genders, where they have traveled to, their province, etc\... \[W\]e
built the dashboard on that information thinking this would be great."
Laura was sitting in her car, dogs jumping up at the window because they
expected to be taken for a walk, when she described the consequent
frustrations to me. "We are really struggling to get the data that we
used to get at the beginning. So, we decided to change the dashboard and
add international graphs and an African one and compare South Africa to
other countries... I know we can definitely get data for that."

Suggestions from the frustrated public that MHC assist with sourcing
primary data seemed untenable. "I mean, we agree in principle that
people should be assisting," said Alastair, "but it's a capacity issue
at the moment for most of us." In a more recent email, Laura told me how
much work went into processing the data. "Collecting and keeping the
database up to date is the most time-consuming part---that part could
not be automated because the data was being published either in PDFs or
infographics on social media." At the time, even the NCIS website's own
dashboard was stalled.[^59] "Their data is further out of date as far as
we can tell," said Alastair, "which suggests, perhaps, that there is a
huge capacity issue there." 

### The Overlooked Problems at the Source of the Data {#the-overlooked-problems-at-the-source-of-the-data .BOOK_Heading-3}

The frustrations of MHC, and the struggle for reliable data updates
during the lockdown, speaks to a larger issue at hand. There are few
instances of fully automated data generation. There is always human
labor and material conditions involved at some point in the data chain.
What Episode 2 of Media Diaries shows---beyond the trials and
tribulations of a small team of industrious data journalists---is that
even the grand global data visualizations of Google, the BBC, and the
New York Times rely on the same single local sources of information that
the MHC dashboard used. In fact, both the BBC and Al Jazeera have made
explicit use of data from the MHC dashboard. When you scroll down to a
global overview of COVID-19 cases on Google's dashboard, the material
and labor constraints that hamper data collection in South Africa gets
lost in the big sea of big data, aestheticized to encourage us to accept
data as quantified facts. Our data-literacy can create dangerous false
confidence when reading these dashboards and widgets. For example,
Tanzania has stopped reporting data on May 8, 2020, after a final
submission of 509 cases and 21 deaths.[^60] When you zoom out on most
COVID-19 dashboards, Tanzania's figures still stand at those paltry
numbers. Has Tanzania, and Africa at large, been spared from the worst
outbreaks of COVID-19? WHO special envoy Samba Sow warned of a "silent
epidemic" in Africa due to a lack of testing on the continent, meaning
data silences such as in Tanzania can also be caused by obfuscated data
reporting.[^61]

Since Media Diaries came out in April, a third member, Gemma Gatticchi,
joined the MHC team to alleviate the labor of keeping the dashboard
updated. Fortunately, the Department of Health also started consistently
releasing daily updates. However, as Laura told me in a recent email
that the data updates are still unreliable. "Sometimes it would be 1 PM,
sometimes it would be close to midnight. We had many late nights waiting
for the updates." It's easy to forget about the struggles of Alastair,
Laura, and the governmental staff at every level of COVID-19 data
collection in South Africa, sitting at my laptop in Rotterdam,
interacting with the blue dots blooming over the African continent.

***Risks and Uncertainties in Contact Tracing Apps***

*After weeks of debate about privacy and data protection issues, there
is an urgent need to interrogate the effectiveness and social impact of
contact-tracking applications to fight COVID-19. The proposal by Google
and Apple imposes a model to govern the pandemic that many countries
have adopted. However, their applications are useless in the face of
scarce resources, such as health personnel, reliable rapid diagnostic
tests, and legal reforms. Tracing systems based on apps could also
systematically exclude vulnerable social groups, and threaten individual
and collective rights.*

### El despliegue de sistemas de vigilancia casi nunca es temporal {#el-despliegue-de-sistemas-de-vigilancia-casi-nunca-es-temporal .BOOK_Heading-3}

En 2003 entraba en funcionamiento el sistema EURODAC, una base de datos
biométricos para coordinar las peticiones de asilo en Europa. Los datos
eran sencillos, solo las huellas dactilares y el país de entrada en la
UE de quien demandaba asilo, con un único objetivo:  evitar peticiones
de asilo en más de un país a la vez. Tras varias reformas, en la
actualidad EURODAC es utilizado para controlar la inmigración irregular,
deportar y separar a familias y es empleado por las fuerzas de seguridad
como una base de datos de criminales. El ámbito e interoperabilidad de
este sistema sigue ampliándose. La actual propuesta de reforma, en
trámite, incluye la ampliación de datos (biografía, documentos,
fotografía), la reducción de la edad obligatoria para el registro a 6
años, la integración sistemática de los datos en los sistemas de visado,
viajeros y policiales europeos y la cesión de datos a terceros países.
Así, una herramienta sencilla y con un único fin se ha ido ampliando y
reformando, incluyendo el marco legal, hasta convertirse en un sistema
de vigilancia a escala continental de colectivos vulnerables.[^62]

Inmersos en el debate continuo sobre la gestión de la pandemia, las
narrativas oficiales insisten en que si algo tienen en común las
diferentes estrategias de éxito es el rol de la tecnología en la
vigilancia epidemiológica de la población. En las últimas semanas, se ha
intensificado el debate sobre la necesidad de adoptar aplicaciones de
rastreo en nuestros móviles que permitan notificar a los usuarios que
han estado en contacto con una persona infectada. Para ello, se
registraría la línea temporal de desplazamientos y/o la lista de
personas con las que se interactúa para informar a una persona que ha
estado en contacto con un caso positivo. Se nos presentan China,
Singapur o Corea del Sur como casos de éxito basados en la tecnología y
se sugiere, en aras de controlar la epidemia, sacrificar la privacidad y
autonomía permitiendo a estados y empresas gestionar, a través de la
tecnología, aspectos de nuestras vidas a los que hasta ahora no podían
acceder, como la libertad de circulación, el acceso a nuestro puesto de
trabajo o nuestra libertad para reunirnos con otras personas.

La propuesta, sin precedentes, ha encendido numerosos debates alertando
de los riesgos de que tal información exista o si es posible implementar
estos sistemas mitigando al máximo estos riesgos. Al debate se
suman *Google y Apple*[^63] con una propuesta de rastreos de contactos
descentralizada y que parece ofrecer ciertas garantías de privacidad,
aunque no debemos olvidar que estas dos empresas ya tienen en su poder
el historial de movilidad de la mayor parte de los usuarios de sus
terminales. En este texto interrogamos críticamente las opciones
tecnológicas que se están barajando en Europa y España y cuestionamos
tanto su función técnica como su rol desde la economía política y los
riesgos que entrañan. En un momento de shock colectivo conviene no
aceptar sistemas de control social irreversibles. La experiencia de
casos como EURODAC nos dice que una vez puestos en marcha no se vuelven
a apagar.

### El (Fracasado) Modelo de Singapur {#el-fracasado-modelo-de-singapur .BOOK_Heading-3}

El debate viene presentado por el "éxito" del  modelo empleado en
Singapur, país que aparentemente había controlado la pandemia en marzo
gracias, en parte, al rastreo de contactos a través de los móviles, y de
un estudio matemático publicado en *Science* el 30 de marzo.[^64] Frente
a la idea de registrar dónde ha estado una persona, Singapur implementó
el rastreo de contactos, es decir, con quién ha estado esa persona. Si
tenemos una base de datos de contactos entre personas, cuando una
presente síntomas y se confirme su caso, se podrá notificar a la lista
de personas que estuvieron en contacto con esta persona. Este sistema
funciona utilizando los sensores bluetooth de los móviles para poder
establecer qué dispositivos están cerca de otros. Para ello, una
aplicación emite periódicamente una serie de señales que son detectadas
y almacenadas por los móviles de otras personas.

Frente a esta propuesta, otras opciones pasan por registrar todos los
movimientos de una persona para ver si se ha coincidido en lugar y hora
con una persona infectada o ha accedido a un recinto donde estuvo esta
persona. Esto se implementaría, como ya lo hace Google para fines
publicitarios, utilizando todos los sensores disponibles del móvil (GPS,
wifi, bluetooth, brújula, acelerómetro, etc.). Además de estas opciones,
los estados pueden implementar otras, como ocurre en el caso polaco o
taiwanés, donde las personas en cuarentena deben activar la ubicación de
su móvil y sacarse una fotografía en el interior de su casa tres veces
al día o de lo contrario recibirán la visita de la policía. El catálogo
de aplicaciones,[^65] como vemos, es variado.

Recientemente, el caso de "éxito" de Singapur dejó de serlo cuando a
finales de abril el país tuvo que adoptar el confinamiento de la
población[^66] ante la imposibilidad de controlar la expansión del virus
por medios tecnológicos. Las causas son múltiples; por ejemplo, se ha
apuntado al hacinamiento de trabajadores inmigrantes pero también al
exceso de confianza en las capacidades del sistema de seguimiento de
contactos a través de móviles.[^67] Este sistema de rastreo de móviles
de Singapur no ha funcionado por varias razones: 1) sólo 1 de cada 6
personas había instalado la aplicación; 2) para que la aplicación
funcionase correctamente el móvil necesitaba estar desbloqueado[^68] y
la aplicación en primer plano (es decir, no se podía utilizar otra
función del móvil simultáneamente); 3) y fuera del objetivo de este
texto, el porcentaje tan alto de personas contagiadas y asintomáticas no
diagnosticadas reduce mucho su eficacia. Además, aunque se nos presente
el caso como un éxito basado en la tecnología, el gobierno de Singapur
insiste en el que el sistema requería de una buena cantidad de
rastreadores humanos para tener un control efectivo de los casos. Esta
segunda parte de la historia no suele estar presente entre los
promotores de estos sistemas automáticos.

### Propuestas Europeas y Modelos con "Privacidad Desde el Diseño" {#propuestas-europeas-y-modelos-con-privacidad-desde-el-diseño .BOOK_Heading-3}

El modelo de rastreo de movilidad ha sido descartado por la mayoría de
países europeos tanto por la presión de la opinión pública como por la
regulación de protección de datos de la UE. De este modo, muchos países
como Alemania, Francia, Suiza[^69], Reino Unido[^70] o Italia están
estudiando o desarrollando sistemas de rastreo de interacciones entre
personas. La posición de España aún no es clara al respecto. En todo
caso, la UE acaba de publicar un serie de recomendaciones para el
rastreo de contactos[^71]: las autoridades sanitarias deberán aprobar
las aplicaciones y ser responsables del cumplimiento de la normativa
europea de protección de datos incluyendo a las autoridades nacionales
de protección de datos, los usuarios deben tener control total sobre sus
datos, la instalación de la app debe ser voluntaria, no se podrán
rastrear los movimientos de las personas, los datos deben almacenarse de
forma cifrada únicamente en los móviles, las apps deben ser
interoperables entre países de la UE y deberían desactivarse en cuanto
no sean necesarias. Un ejemplo es la aplicación propuesta por la
Generalitat de Catalunya, encargada a una empresa de marketing
y geofencing [^72], que incumpliría muchas de estas recomendaciones y
probablemente cualquier reglamento europeo de protección de datos.[^73]

La mayoría de las soluciones cabe en dos categorías, centralizadas o
descentralizadas, que se diferencian en los grados de protección de la
privacidad para la ciudadanía. El punto común es que todas se basan en
el uso de bluetooth para detectar a personas a nuestro alrededor con las
que hemos coincidido.

La opción centralizada consiste en el envío sistemático de información
de interacciones de riesgo con personas a un servidor central. En este
caso, se intenta mantener el anonimato dando al móvil un código (o
pseudo-identificador) que permite que el servidor central notifique
alguna interacción con un positivo de COVID-19 pero no permite
identificar a la persona.

La opción descentralizada y con "privacidad desde el diseño" consiste en
mantener los datos exclusivamente en el móvil de una persona
(descentralizada) y evitar el uso de identificadores que puedan revelar
la identidad de la persona pero que permitan que el sistema funcione.
Este sería el ejemplo de DP-3T[^74], que surge de un grupo
multidisciplinar de investigadores en privacidad y seguridad de varias
instituciones europeas. En este caso, cada terminal genera una serie de
identificadores efímeros (cadenas de caracteres aleatorias) que emite a
través de bluetooth. Estas cadenas cambian cada poco tiempo de manera
que otros terminales pueden guardarlas y estimar cuánto tiempo han
estado cerca de una persona sin saber quién es esta persona. En este
caso, tanto los identificadores efímeros producidos como detectados se
almacenan únicamente en el teléfono. Ante un caso positivo los
identificadores efímeros generados desde un terminal se añadirían a una
base de datos central que los teléfonos de todos los ciudadanos
descargarían periódicamente para comprobar que los identificadores que
han ido almacenando coinciden con los de alguna persona que haya dado
positivo. De esta forma no se puede revelar la identidad de ninguna
persona ni el lugar de la interacción. Para más detalles sobre el
protocolo DP-3T animamos a consultar la documentación oficial y la
versión en castellano del cómic explicativo.[^75]

A este tipo de diseños se les considera "privacidad desde el diseño"
porque la privacidad se garantiza a nivel de diseño y código, y no se
implementa en base a confianza a terceras partes. El equipo detrás del
DP-3T genera confianza por varios factores que no se dan a la vez en
otras propuestas: privacidad por diseño, el equipo tiene experiencia y
es interdisciplinar, la documentación y código son abiertos y
discutibles[^76], el sistema está siendo auditado por terceras partes,
etc. Por último, el nivel de centralización o descentralización pueden
ser graduales. Este es el caso de Reino Unido[^77], donde una clave de
cifrado maestra protege, basándonos en nuestra confianza en el buen uso
y custodia del organismo correspondiente, que se puedan usar los
pseudo-identificadores (que luego se utilizan para generar
identificadores efímeros) que genera la app al instalarse para
identificar a personas reales. Por lo demás, esta opción tiene bastantes
similitudes funcionales con DP-3T. Es complejo entrar en más detalles
sobre el funcionamiento de las propuestas, ya que los cambios van por
días (de hecho, en el momento de escribir este artículo el NHS está
considerando descentralizar su propuesta[^78] en parte para cumplir con
los requisitos técnicos y de privacidad que impone Apple, como veremos a
continuación). Sea cual sea la opción, para completar el puzle, es
necesario un servidor central, de la autoridad sanitaria, donde
registrar los códigos de las personas diagnosticadas con COVID-19.

Hace un mes, Google y Apple anunciaban una alianza para desarrollar un
sistema de seguimiento de contactos a través de los móviles. Su
propuesta se inspira en el protocolo de seguimiento DP-3T: detección de
contactos con personas a través de las balizas bluetooth con
identificadores efímeros que se almacenan y verifican siempre en el
terminal del usuario. La propuesta de Google y Apple se implantaría a
nivel del sistema operativo en próximas actualizaciones y no queda claro
cómo podría aceptarla o rechazarla el usuario, aunque las primeras
versiones desveladas apuntan a que sería una opción más de la
configuración. La alianza ya ha publicado las especificaciones de la
interfaz de programación para impulsar el desarrollo de aplicaciones que
hagan uso de estos datos.[^79] La idea es que, si bien las
multinacionales proporcionarán esta funcionalidad a nivel del sistema
operativo, sea cada organismo local (estado, autoridad sanitaria, etc.)
quien desarrolle una aplicación que haga uso de esos datos y los integre
dentro del sistema de salud. Por ejemplo, en España el Ministerio de
Sanidad podría desarrollar una aplicación que gestione qué acciones se
disparan después de que nuestro terminal detecte que hemos estado con
una persona diagnosticada de COVID-19.

En cualquier caso, las soluciones de cualquier tipo tendrán que pasar
obligatoriamente por el visto bueno de Google y Apple si quieren ser
operativas. Esto tiene varias razones técnicas: 1) cualquier solución
pasa por la "adopción" masiva por la población, y esto probablemente se
conseguirá con un sistema implantado a nivel del sistema operativo y/o
una notificación a cada persona sugiriendo instalar la aplicación de la
autoridad sanitaria correspondiente; 2) los dispositivos de Apple no
permiten que una aplicación se ejecute en segundo plano por seguridad
(fuente de enfrentamiento reciente entre el Gobierno Francés y
Apple)[^80]; 3) los sensores bluetooth de Android y Apple, a pesar de
estar estandarizados, no son capaces de interaccionar correctamente sin
una serie de modificaciones en las que trabajan las dos compañías. Como
vemos, esta solución tecnológica impone de facto un modelo de gobernanza
sanitaria desde las multinacionales que ya han aceptado países como
Suiza.[^81]

### Más Allá de la Privacidad y Protocolos de Rastreo {#más-allá-de-la-privacidad-y-protocolos-de-rastreo .BOOK_Heading-3}

En mayo de 2020 el debate se sigue centrando en cuestiones de privacidad
y modelo centralizado o descentralizado, pero la única alternativa es
que la que permitan las tecnológicas. Suiza ya está desarrollando su
aplicación sobre la plataforma que ofrecen Google y Apple y la Unión
Europea ha escrito unas recomendaciones que son compatibles con esta
propuesta.

Sin embargo, quedan muchas preguntas por responder. ¿Pueden funcionar
estos sistemas? ¿Bajo qué hipótesis? ¿Afectarán a todas las personas por
igual? ¿Excluirá a colectivos sociales? ¿Deberíamos estar hablando más
de otro tipo de medidas[^82]? En la segunda parte de este artículo
analizaremos si es posible que funcione el rastreo de contactos y qué
problemas y riesgos plantean estas propuestas más allá de cuestiones de
privacidad y protección de datos.

En la primera parte de este artículo hemos analizado los problemas de
puesta en práctica del modelo de rastreo de contactos de Singapur, así
como las propuestas que hay sobre la mesa a nivel europeo. En esta
segunda parte analizamos las hipótesis de éxito del rastreo automatizado
así como riesgos de exclusión e impacto desigual de estos sistemas.

### ¿Podría Funcionar el Rastreo de Contactos? {#podría-funcionar-el-rastreo-de-contactos .BOOK_Heading-3}

El debate sobre modelos de aplicaciones de rastreo apenas cuestiona la
supuesta utilidad de este despliegue y se está centrando
fundamentalmente en el cómo hacerlo y el impacto en la privacidad de las
personas y la compatibilidad con leyes de protección de datos. El
Parlamento Europeo acaba de publicar un documento sobre el rastreo de
móviles como estrategia de lucha contra el coronavirus[^83] donde las
referencias sobre utilidad de estas soluciones tecnológicas provienen de
medios de comunicación estadounidenses, como Wired, caracterizados por
su devoción por el solucionismo tecnológico. Como en otros temas, sobre
todo relacionados con la puesta en marcha de sistemas de vigilancia en
Europa, el Europarlamento sigue las recomendaciones de la Comisión
Europea que "recomienda apoyar las estrategias de salida del
confinamiento que se basen en datos móviles y aplicaciones"[^84] sin
aportar ninguna evidencia sobre la supuesta utilidad. No obstante, según
las hipótesis y simulaciones matemáticas del mencionado artículo
en *Science*[^85] del equipo de Ferretti, y que cita Singapur como caso
de éxito (lo era en el momento de escribirse), la adopción generalizada
de esta aplicación, por parte de la población,  junto con medidas de
distanciamiento físico,  ayudaría a controlar la pandemia.

Diversos artículos e incluso el propio Parlamento Europeo citan al
estudio de Ferretti para justificar que una tasa de adopción de la
aplicación del 60 % de la población podría controlar la epidemia.[^86]
Sin embargo, esta cifra debe interpretarse correctamente y comprender
las condiciones necesarias. En el estudio se plantean varios escenarios
(ver siguiente figura) que dependen de lo rápido que se aísle a una
persona diagnosticada y también a las personas asintomáticas que han
estado en contacto con esta. Todos los escenarios asumen un ritmo
reproductivo R0=2.0. Tanto los periodistas como el Europarlamento
consideran el escenario más favorable, que es el aislamiento inmediato
(figura de la derecha). Ignorando los márgenes de error, si un 60 % de
las personas diagnosticadas utiliza la aplicación y se aísla
inmediatamente tras el diagnóstico, y el 60 % de las personas
asintomáticas con las que estas han estado en contacto son notificadas y
aisladas inmediatamente, se consigue detener la transmisión. En un
escenario de margen de actuación (detección, notificación y aislamiento)
de 24h se necesitaría aislar al 80 % de las personas con síntomas y al
60 % de sus contactos. El matiz de la ventana de actuación es importante
en la operacionalización, porque significa que una buena parte de
personas asintomáticas será puesta en cuarentena sin realizar un
diagnóstico. A partir de 3 días de margen de actuación el uso de
aplicaciones solo ralentizará la propagación. A día de hoy, en la
mayoría de países y en particular en España, estas hipótesis de margen
de notificación y actuación son inviables, además de otros problemas que
comentaremos a continuación.

### Efectividad de las Aplicaciones de Rastreo en Diferentes Escenarios {#efectividad-de-las-aplicaciones-de-rastreo-en-diferentes-escenarios .BOOK_Heading-3}

Por el contrario, otros estudios interdisciplinares difieren de esta
hipótesis. El estudio COVID-19 Rapid Evidence Review: Exit through the
App Store?[^87], publicado por el Ada Lovelace Institute, concluye que
"No hay pruebas que apoyen el despliegue nacional inmediato de
aplicaciones de rastreo de síntomas, aplicaciones de rastreo de
contactos digitales y certificados digitales de inmunidad". Esta
conclusión afecta a las aplicaciones de rastreo, pero también a las de
autodiagnóstico, como la que el Gobierno de España acaba de encargar a
*Telefónica*[^88] o la aplicación de autodiagnóstico de la Comunidad de
Madrid (con un algoritmo insultantemente simple[^89]) que además se
descubrió que recopilaba sistemáticamente datos sensibles de las
personas[^90]. Por otro lado, el rastreo y gestión de personas a través
de sus móviles ya se ha probado con anterioridad. El investigador Sean
McDonald, quien estudió este tipo de información en la pandemia de ébola
de África en 2014-5 concluye en una entrevista que "el mayor
determinante de la mortalidad del COVID-19 es la capacidad del sistema
sanitario"[^91] y advierte de que los gobiernos están enfocando la
pandemia como un problema de gestión de las personas más que de
construcción de capacidad de respuesta y apunta a la falta de evidencias
de que los modelos predictivos matemáticos y la tecnología de vigilancia
puedan ayudar a controlar el virus.

Ante la ausencia de datos de validación, resulta difícil pensar en
experimentos, fuera de planes piloto minuciosos, que puedan extrapolar
sus conclusiones a la diversidad de situaciones de la vida cotidiana.
Por poner un ejemplo, la exposición durante unos segundos puede ser
significativa entre dos personas sin mascarilla a una distancia menor de
dos metros o no serlo si una de ellas la lleva, o puede no ser
significativo que una persona comparta transporte público con 20 más si
todas llevan la protección adecuada o mantienen la distancia oportuna.
Dos vecinos de pared pueden detectarse como contactos y no haberse
cruzado en semanas. Por otro lado, también es necesario estudiar la
capacidad real de la tecnología bluetooth para estimar la distancia
entre dos dispositivos. Ante esto, solo cabe esperar una cantidad
importante de falsos positivos (personas que reciban una notificación de
riesgo no justificada) y de falsos negativos (interacciones de riesgo
que no son detectadas). Las capturas de la nueva actualización del
sistema operativo de Apple (figura anterior) indican que el usuario
puede contribuir en el calibrado de estos parámetros, aunque como vemos,
sigue habiendo mucha incertidumbre asociada a la información no medible.

### Más Allá de los Debates Sobre Privacidad: Riesgos sobre Utilidad, Exclusiones y Seguridad {#más-allá-de-los-debates-sobre-privacidad-riesgos-sobre-utilidad-exclusiones-y-seguridad .BOOK_Heading-3}

Además de las limitaciones técnicas de interacción entre terminales y
protocolo de rastreo (que resolverían Google y Apple), se necesitará la
cooperación de la población que disponga de terminales; esto es, que
acepten el rastreo a nivel de sistema operativo, que instalen la
aplicación de la autoridad regional, que se encarguen de llevar el móvil
consigo en todo momento durante su desplazamiento y actividad laboral, y
que, por supuesto, acudan a la asistencia sanitaria para que esta
realice tests fiables y se desencadene la alerta a la cadena de
contactos. Para todo esto es necesario que las personas confíen en los
actores tecnopolíticos y entiendan los componentes del sistema, lo que
nos lleva a privacidad desde el diseño, código abierto, protecciones
legales garantistas, limitación de uso, etc. pero también que las
personas no sean penalizadas laboral o socialmente al dar a conocer su
enfermedad o al ser etiquetados como sospechosos por la aplicación y que
cuenten con sistemas de protección social adecuados, como ya
apuntamos en otro artículo.[^92]

Resulta paradójico que el artículo del equipo de Ferretti[^93] argumente
que uno de los problemas del confinamiento sea que los "individuos con
bajos ingresos tengan capacidad limitada para quedarse en casa" y que a
la vez la solución sea disponer de un móvil de última generación con un
sistema operativo actualizado que incorpore los cambios técnicos
necesarios para implementar la solución tecnológica. Recientemente, *Ars
Technica* publicó un artículo en el que se afirma que dos mil millones
de teléfonos inteligentes activos[^94] no tienen la tecnología necesaria
para participar en el esquema de detección de contactos propuesto por
*Apple* y *Google*. Precisamente, la mayoría de estos dispositivos
incompatibles son los que utilizan las personas con pocos ingresos o las
personas mayores. Otros 1500 millones de personas que utilizan móviles
"no inteligentes" quedarían excluidas directamente. Por supuesto,
segmentos completos de la población, como personas en exclusión social,
mayores o niños no tienen móviles de ningún tipo. Ante semejantes datos,
parece naíf pensar en un escenario de adopción generalizada de esta
situación que además no incremente, aún más, las desigualdades
estructurales de nuestras sociedades.

Las exclusiones del sistema de alarma no tienen que ver solo con el
"parque" móvil sino también con las variables, pesos y umbrales del
modelo riesgo. La conceptualización matemática del riesgo al modelar
comportamientos puede resultar en impactos muy dispares a diferentes
grupos sociales y colectivos, a menudo los más vulnerables, que no se
han considerado durante el diseño y validación del modelo. La
experiencia los sistemas de análisis de movilidad de las personas a
menudo conceptualizan técnicamente el fenómeno que estudian excluyendo a
colectivos[^95]. Pensemos, por ejemplo, cómo se mueve e interactúa,
junto con su móvil, una trabajadora interna en un hogar o una abogada
con un despacho propio.

En cualquier caso, todas las opciones de seguimiento de contactos a
través de bluetooth son susceptibles de una serie de ataques
individuales o globales al conjunto del sistema. Hablar de los problemas
de interoperabilidad y seguridad de bluetooth daría para varios
artículos, pero aquí daremos algunos ejemplos. Es factible inyectar
falsos encuentros a los móviles para disparar falsas alarmas o por el
contrario sabotear la detección de contactos. Además, es posible
desplegar un sistema de dispositivos bluetooth a lo largo de una ciudad
para recoger identificadores efímeros y direcciones físicas de los
sensores bluetooth (dirección MAC) para reindentificar a las personas.
Independientemente del protocolo, DP-3-T u otros, las aplicaciones de
las autoridades regionales necesitan comunicarse con un servidor central
que podría revelar la identidad de las personas. Para más información,
el equipo de DP-3T ha publicado un análisis completo de estos y otros
riesgos.[^96] Las amenazas no son solo para la protección individual,
sino que puede afectar a nivel de los estados hasta el punto de que los
servicios de seguridad de Países Bajos enviaron una carta[^97] de cinco
páginas al Ministerio de Sanidad Neerlandés advirtiendo de los riesgos
de seguridad nacional que podría suponer el despliegue apresurado de
aplicaciones de estas características.

### **Aplicaciones de Rastreo: De Bala de Plata a Posible Parte de una Solución** {#aplicaciones-de-rastreo-de-bala-de-plata-a-posible-parte-de-una-solución .BOOK_Heading-3}

El rastreo de contactos es una práctica de salud pública utilizada para
la respuesta a enfermedades infecciosas[^98]. Necesitamos protocolos de
detección, investigación y reacción rápidos para los que las
aplicaciones de seguimiento pueden ser un elemento más pero en ningún
caso sustituir ni menoscabar los trabajos epidemiológicos hechos por
personas que, como tales, tienen capacidad y flexibilidad para adaptarse
e indagar en situaciones diversas. En las narrativas sobre la eficacia
tecnológica se suelen eliminar tanto las incertidumbres funcionales o de
seguridad en torno a las herramientas como el rol de las personas en las
tareas y su interacción con la tecnología. A menudo se ignora que
algunos de los países que han tenido éxito deteniendo la pandemia
coinciden con los que en 2003 sufrieron la epidemia SARS. La preparación
y respuesta ante epidemias van más allá de las soluciones técnicas,
significa "disponer de recursos, competencias, planes y legitimidad
política para desplegar las soluciones cuando hagan falta".[^99] Las
aplicaciones son inútiles ante la escasez de otros recursos, como
personal sanitario con formación específica, disponibilidad de pruebas
diagnósticas fiables y rápidas, reformas legales o respuestas
sociosanitaria en caso de contagio, que a día de hoy, siguen siendo
insuficientes. Por tanto, su papel debe ser de apoyo a las
intervenciones desde la Salud y la Sanidad Públicas y no deben servir de
coartada[^100] para evitar tomar otro tipo de decisiones. Por ejemplo,
numerosos medios de comunicación y profesionales están denunciando
la falta de planes y personal con formación epidemiológica para seguir
el rastro de nuevos contagios.[^101] En cualquier caso, los márgenes
temporales de diagnóstico y aislamiento propuestos por el equipo de
Ferretti, que proporcionan la evidencia científica que justifica el
despliegue de estos sistemas de vigilancia, están lejos de ser realistas
en nuestro país.

Resulta sorprendente y preocupante que, en general, periodistas,
políticos y ciudadanía se centren en debates sobre estas aplicaciones
mientras se deja de lado medidas esenciales y con efecto positivo
demostrado como el refuerzo de la atención primaria, desmantelada en la
Comunidad de Madrid durante la gestión de la crisis. Puestos a hacer una
inversión tecnológica, parece más sensato invertir esfuerzos en mejorar
la calidad e integración de datos desde las diferentes administraciones
sobre casos confirmados, datos que ya están en manos de las
administraciones públicas custodiados por empleados públicos y sujetos a
una protección legal clara.

Los problemas de reutilización de la tecnología siempre van a planear
sobre cualquier opción. Sabemos que la mayoría de sistemas de vigilancia
que se han implantado durante diferentes crisis han permanecido después
en la sociedad. Durante el confinamiento, Marruecos ha usado la
información de localización de aplicaciones de citas para identificar a
hombres homosexuales[^102]. Nada impide, con opción descentralizada o no
descentralizada, que regímenes no democráticos obliguen a entregar las
claves efímeras recibidas para comprobar si un grupo de personas han
tenido contacto entre ellas. Hemos de considerar el riesgo de que estas
aplicaciones sean parte o normalicen los sistemas de vigilancia a las
trabajadoras y trabajadores, tal y como advierte el *European Trade
Union Institute*.[^103] No podemos olvidar los riesgos para la seguridad
colectiva tales como la generación de falsas alarmas por actores con
multitud de intereses. Por tanto, estamos ante un movimiento arriesgado
que valorar sin prisas[^104] tras un debate científico, interdisciplinar
y social.

El rastreo de contactos basado en apps excluirá a personas en situación
de vulnerabilidad como personas con pocos ingresos, menores, mayores y,
seguramente, otros grupos que nos cuesta anticipar. Las exclusiones
sistemáticas de grupos de la población afectarán a la precisión y por
tanto a la utilidad real de cualquier solución, descentralizada o no.
Esta advertencia, junto con otras, se plantean en el documento sobre
garantías en derechos del documento "*The Coronavirus (Safeguards) Bill
2020*".[^105] A día de hoy, desconocemos cualquier estudio o simulación
matemática que analice los impactos desiguales que estas soluciones
podrían tener sobre colectivos vulnerables. Debemos, en general,
reflexionar sobre qué significa la validación de la evidencia, quién la
realiza y qué significa esta validación para cada comunidad.

Cualquier despliegue de sistemas de rastreo necesita la adopción masiva
a unos niveles probablemente muy difíciles de conseguir considerando las
exclusiones de los sistemas propuestos. En todo caso, sería esencial
conseguir la confianza de la sociedad. Las personas tienen que saber que
su privacidad y derechos serán respetados, y para ello, la instalación
de la app debe ser un acto voluntario y sin consecuencias negativas para
el individuo en caso de no hacerse o no poderse hacer. No podemos
permitir que los grupos más vulnerables vean mermados sus derechos de
movilidad, laborales o de acceso a espacios por no poder pagar un móvil
con las prestaciones necesarias.

Debemos permanecer vigilantes ante las propuestas de solucionismo
tecnológico[^106] donde las empresas están no solo imponiendo un modelo
de gobernanza sobre la gestión de la pandemia, que afecta a derechos
individuales y colectivos, sino limitando el imaginario de soluciones y
sirviendo a la agenda de la austeridad con la promesa de reemplazar o
reducir las medidas de salud pública eficaces por medios tecnológicos
inteligentes. No debemos olvidar que las intervenciones sociotécnicas no
solo monitorizan, sino que disciplinan a la ciudadanía, y que dejar que
las empresas de Silicon Valley definan e implementen la gobernanza de
cada vez más aspectos de la vida es un ataque directo a la democracia y
los derechos individuales y colectivos.

## Surveillance in the time of COVID-19: The case of the Indian contact tracing app Aarogya Setu (Soumyo Das) {#surveillance-in-the-time-of-covid-19-the-case-of-the-indian-contact-tracing-app-aarogya-setu-soumyo-das .BOOK_Heading-2}

COVID-19 has brought governments across the world back to the drawing
boards to design efficient pandemic containment strategies. In India,
while reports suggest that the rise in number of cases has declined from
exponential levels, the spread continues. The government, alongside
enforcing a complete lockdown of all human activity in non-essential
services and sectors, has considered the use of digital technologies
(ICTs) to monitor and control the spread of the virus as an
informational and preventive model. In tune with other national
governments, including those of Singapore and China, on April 2, 2020
the Government of India launched the "contact tracing
technology" initiative called *Aarogya Setu*. Developed by the National
Informatics Center of the Ministry of Electronics and Information
Technology, the mobile application is available in eleven national
languages. As of April 25, it has reached 7.5 million registered
users.[^107]

The application, designed to keep track of the travel and contact
history of an individual, can be downloaded by users voluntarily. It
registers the personal information of users, including name, age,
gender, health status, and recent travel history. Asking users to
respond to a series of questions designed to assess if the person is
COVID-19 positive, Aarogya Setu generates a Unique Digital Identifier
(UDI) number for the individual. It uses Bluetooth and GPS to collect
other data. The Bluetooth connectivity allows the application to record
details of other registered users that the registered individual comes
in contact with. The location tracking system (GPS) constantly registers
the location of a user at 15-minute intervals. Using this data, Aarogya
Setu assigns the user a COVID-19 status: *low risk, high risk,
positive*, or *negative*. In the initial phase, users' data is stored
locally on their mobile device. For those who are assessed to be
positive, their data is transferred from the mobile device to a national
server for assessment and communication purposes---which raises a number
of concerns.

### **Aarogya Setu Raises Privacy and Security Concerns** {#aarogya-setu-raises-privacy-and-security-concerns .BOOK_Heading-3}

The application is supposed to empower the government to analyse the
virus spread in a localized area, and inform individuals who came in
contact with the positive individuals about self-isolation and further
steps. Two things have to be kept in mind about the application.
Firstly, its effectiveness depends on the individual practice of
self-reporting symptoms in an honest and timely manner. Secondly, it was
designed for smartphone users and participation is voluntary, meaning
the app can effectively only monitor a subset of Indians.[^108] As Jason
Say, Senior Director of the Government Technology Agency of Singapore,
argues,[^109] "automated contact testing is not a panacea," and "a
competent human-in-the-loop system with sufficient capacity" is a more
effective strategy than relying solely on techno-centric solutions.

On top of that, Aarogya Setu comes with its fair share of privacy and
security problems. To start with, with no comprehensive legislation in
the Indian lawbooks that outlines individual privacy protections,
application users have no choice but to agree to privacy policies set by
the developers, as instructed by the Government of India.
This policy provides only a sketchy outline of where and for how long
individual data will be retained.[^110] The majority of the text offers
only a string of vague statements that don't disclose who owns and
controls access to the data. Specifically, the policy reads that
"persons carrying out medical and administrative interventions necessary
in relation to COVID-19" can gain access to the data. Given that
practically all ministries and departments of the Government of India
are playing an active role in devising strategies and implementing
processes to contain the spread of the virus, policy statements like
this evoke ample chances for the "interdepartmental exchanges of
people's personal information," based on an analysis of the
application's privacy by the Internet Freedom Foundation (EFF).[^111]

Beyond the concerns surrounding undisclosed and vague data use and data
protection policies, the fact that individuals are assigned a Unique
Digital Identifier number raises additional privacy concerns. First,
given that all individuals are provided with a static identity number,
there are concrete chances of identity breach. Moreover, all individuals
in India have a national Unique Identity Number (a so-called "Aadhar
Number") associated with the contact details of the same mobile device
used to run Aarogya Setu. Linking the UDI with a Unique Identity Number
amplifies risks of data sharing. For example, these two identities might
be leaked, potentially linking biographical information, location, and
contact history of registered users of Aarogya Setu with their Aadhar
number. Numerous cases have also been recorded of the National Unique
Identity system being used to link identity metrics, including linking
an individual's financial accounts with their social welfare program
accounts.[^112] The same harmful data linkage might happen for
individual data collected with Aarogya Setu. Finally, fears have
multiplied with intel sources reporting that software already available
in the market can bypass the system security and extract an individual's
sensitive information. [^113]

### **Voluntary Adoption?** {#voluntary-adoption .BOOK_Heading-3}

While downloading the application is voluntary, certain states have made
individual registration on the application mandatory. For example, in
New Delhi, Mr. Surjit K. Singh, Director of National Center for Disease
Control, has strongly recommended the Delhi government to allow people
to enter the city capital only after they have installed the
application[^114], therefore setting the tone for using the application
for monitoring inter-district and inter-state movement of people.
Similarly, the Tamil Nadu state government has urged employees of all
higher education institutions in the state to use the application.[^115]
App-based platforms like Zomato have made Aarogya Setu registration
mandatory for food delivery personnel, while IT companies have mandated
the same for employees who are reporting to an office.[^116]
Furthermore, both government and private organizations are actively
pushing individuals to register on the Aarogya Setu application. Reports
exist of the government working towards procuring thousands of
wristbands to be integrated with the application for greater individual
monitoring.[^117]

### **A "Bridge to Wellness"** {#a-bridge-to-wellness .BOOK_Heading-3}

With no documentation available at the time of writing for Aarogya Setu,
organizations such as the *Internet Freedom
Foundation*[^118] and *Software Freedom Law Center*[^119] have raised
concerns that the application is a black-box. They have called for more
transparency on the algorithmic functioning of the application.
Ironically, the name of the application---which can be roughly
translated as "Bridge to Wellness"---suggests empowerment and better
futures. But what would it take for the app to yield the "wellness" its
name evokes? It is time for individuals and action groups in India to
raise demands for a greater transparency regarding the functioning of
the application. The government must address the privacy concerns of its
citizens. It must provide clarity on who owns the data, where it is
stored, who can access it, and for how long it will be stored. Until
such concerns are addressed and effective measures taken, Aarogya Setu
only promises to usher in a world of algorithmic surveillance.

***The Other Epidemic: The Feminicides that are not Tallied***

*As the COVID-19 virus spreads across Central America, another pandemic
is flying under the radar. The lockdown induced by the pandemic has
worsened domestic violence. This chapter explores the efforts of Mexican
women to raise awareness of gender violence, and reflects on how data
facilitates their activism.*

Mientras la pandemia provocada por el COVID-19 avanza en Latinoamérica,
existe otra pandemia que sigue invisible: la creciente cantidad de casos
de violencia de género que arrasa en México. Los números siguen
aumentando, como la consecuencia no deseada de la cuarentena impuesta
por el gobierno para combatir el contagio del virus. Esta violencia de
género es la otra epidemia que lleva años cobrando vidas en México. ¿Qué
están haciendo las mujeres mexicanas para visibilizar la violencia de
género en tiempos de cuarentena?

### Violencia de Género en México y la Movilización Feminista {#violencia-de-género-en-méxico-y-la-movilización-feminista .BOOK_Heading-3}

La violencia de género ya era una epidemia en México cuando se dieron
los primeros casos positivos de COVID-19 en El País. Durante el 2019
asesinaron a 3,825 mujeres, cifra que la geofísica María Salguero ha
rastreado a través de su mapa de feminicidios.[^120] El proyecto, que
comenzó en 2016 y que se nutre de los asesinatos a mujeres reportados en
la prensa, indica que en México se asesinaba por lo menos a diez mujeres
al día. Cabe notar que estas no son cifras oficiales gubernamentales,
las cuales difieren mucho de las de este proyecto generado por la
ciudadanía.

En febrero de este año las redes sociales se llenaron de los hashtags
\#JusticiaParaTodas y \#CosasQuePasanPorSerMujer.[^121] La sociedad
mexicana se había enfurecido por los asesinatos de la pequeña Fátima e
Ingrid Escamilla. El caso de Fátima se trató de una niña de 7 años
secuestrada, asesinada y mutilada por sus vecinos. Ingrid Escamilla fue
una mujer asesinada y mutilada, cuyas imágenes del cuerpo sin vida
fueron publicadas en varios medios de comunicación. Como resultado, las
fotografías fueron compartidas en las redes sociales. Esto causó que
muchos usuarios etiquetaran fotografías hermosas con el nombre de Ingrid
Escamilla, para "limpiar" su nombre y hacer que se perdieran las
imágenes publicadas por los medios de comunicación amarillistas.

Este año, el 8 de marzo, Día Internacional de la Mujer, fue muy especial
para las mexicanas. Ese día salieron a la calle cientos de mujeres para
protestar contra la violencia de género, un problema que lleva años en
la sociedad latinoamericana y que parece empeorar cada vez más.Las
manifestantes demandaron un cambio en la estructura social para que ya
no se permita la violencia sexual, exigieron igualdad de género en las
políticas públicas y la no impunidad a los agresores, y la transparencia
en los datos sobre violencia de género.

Hasta ese momento, todo el cambio que se había logrado venía desde las
mismas sociedades, de las mujeres reunidas bajo un objetivo y sin el
apoyo del gobierno mexicano. Cuatro días después, el 12 de marzo, se
declaró la pandemia mundial, y en México el 20 de marzo el gobierno
federal decretó la cuarentena. Pero esto no fue lo peor para las mujeres
mexicanas. La mayoría de los casos de violencia de género se da en los
hogares, y ahora muchas mujeres se vieron obligadas a estar encerradas
junto con sus agresores.

### Sin Mecanismos Para Frenar la Violencia de Género Durante la Pandemia {#sin-mecanismos-para-frenar-la-violencia-de-género-durante-la-pandemia .BOOK_Heading-3}

En México se están haciendo esfuerzos para frenar el contagio de
COVID-19, pero no existen mecanismos para frenar la violencia doméstica
de género. Esto hace que las mujeres mexicanas no sólo tengan miedo de
un contagio, sino que también aumenta el miedo a sufrir violencia en sus
casas, sin contar el número de mujeres que viven en condición de
pobreza.

En el Banco Nacional de Datos e Información sobre Casos de Violencia
contra las Mujeres (BANAVIM), se declaró que del 20 de marzo al 2 de
mayo se registraron 19,602 agresiones[^122]^ ^contra la mujer, y el 90%
de estas agresiones fueron cometidas por personas que viven bajo el
mismo techo. El Secretariado Ejecutivo del Sistema Nacional de Seguridad
Pública (SESNSP) mencionó que durante el mes de marzo se recibieron
64,858 llamadas[^123] al 911 debido a violencias contra la mujer, con un
aumento del 23% en comparación con el mes anterior.

Esto indica que cada día de cuarentena se denuncian de manera formal 490
casos de violencia, uno cada tres minutos. Este cálculo no cuenta el
número de casos que se dan en casa y no son denunciados a las
autoridades. Hasta el mes de abril se declararon al menos 210
feminicidios en El País.

Todos los esfuerzos que se han hecho para medir el índice de contagios
han desviado la mirada al problema que afectaba a las mujeres desde hace
años. La crisis provocada por la pandemia es más visible porque ocurre a
nivel mundial y se compara a México con otros países. De esta manera,
los recursos gubernamentales han sido recortados de los programas de
violencia de género para darlos a la infraestructura en el sector salud,
a pesar de que la violencia contra las mujeres sigue creciendo.

### Las Respuestas Desde Abajo {#las-respuestas-desde-abajo .BOOK_Heading-3}

Como ahora están prohibidos los eventos masivos, las marchas y las
protestas como las ocurridas el 8 de marzo, la mejor opción para las
mujeres mexicanas es recurrir al activismo digital, como se vio en los
casos de Fátima e Ingrid Escamilla. El 6 de mayo, el presidente de
México, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, fue cuestionado sobre las políticas
contra la violencia doméstica durante la cuarentena. López Obrador negó
que los índices hubieran aumentado. Los días posteriores, diversas
organizaciones feministas como Brujas del Mar y Luchadoras alzaron la
voz, y junto con otras asociaciones de derechos humanos hicieron
declaratorias públicas en sus redes sociales.

Desde el lunes 11 de mayo, muchísimas mujeres se unieron a exigir que se
visibilice la violencia de género doméstica bajo el hashtag
\#NosotrasTenemosOtrosDatos, para pedir transparencia en la
identificación y publicación de casos de violencia doméstica en todo El
País.

Debido a la pandemia, el activismo de datos -es decir el uso estratégico
de información para generar un cambio social- es cada vez más relevante
y necesario para visualizar todos los problemas que enferman a la
sociedad, no sólo las infecciones de COVID-19 sino también las otras
epidemias como la violencia de género.

## The LGBTQ+ Community During the COVID-19 Pandemic in Brazil (Ricardo H. D. Rohm & José Otávio A. L. Martins) {#the-lgbtq-community-during-the-covid-19-pandemic-in-brazil-ricardo-h.-d.-rohm-josé-otávio-a.-l.-martins .BOOK_Heading-2}

On May 17, the International Day Against Homophobia, Transphobia, and
Biphobia was celebrated. The day promoted international events that
raise awareness of LGBTQ+ rights violations worldwide. This date was
chosen due to the decision of the World Health Organization (WHO) to
remove the term "homosexuality" from the list of mental disorders of the
International Classification of Diseases in 1990, disregarding
homosexuality as a pathology. Even though the date is now remembered as
the day against LGBTQphobia, it is important to remember that so-called
"gender incongruence" was only removed by the WHO from its International
Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD 11) on June
18, 2018.

This date is a great achievement for the LGBTQ+ community, especially if
we consider the context in which the decision took place. In the early
1990s, the world was still reverberating from the spread of AIDS. For
the LGBTQ+ community, notably for those who were born in the 1950s and
1960s and fully experienced the demonization of their bodies during the
1980s, the situation in which we live today, with the COVID-19 pandemic,
elicits painful memories. Still recovering from being considered the
source and proliferator of HIV/AIDS, the LGBTQ+ community seems to once
again being irrationally blamed by authorities and public personalities
for the current pandemic, as we can see in the United States[^124],
Israel[^125], and Iraq[^126]. Situations like these demonstrate the
constant hostile prejudice and discrimination that the LGBTQ+ community
suffers, day after day, year after year, century after century. Even if
we are not at the heart of the matter, we are blamed for it.

This system of oppression constantly puts our community in a situation
of social and emotional vulnerability. The vast majority only lives the
fullness of their sexual orientation and gender identity far away from
the coziness that family and home should symbolize. Many LGBTQ+ people
are only free when they are among friends, a chosen family, lovers, on a
stage performing with a wig on, or waving their flags at Pride parades.
Distance from their family and home could be by choice, when it is
unbearable to cope with prejudice, or not, like when they are rejected,
abused, or thrown out of their home. Therefore, we should ask, at a time
when the WHO and other government officials say "stay at home," which
home does the LGBTQ+ community have the option to stay in?

In Marseille, France, a couple was kicked out of the apartment they
rented because they were "the first to be contaminated" by the COVID-19,
a claim with no scientific base, just homophobia.[^127] Exposed to a new
vulnerability only increases the existing ones the LGBTQ+ population has
been facing. Our community is even more targeted during the coronavirus
crisis, as pointed out by the High Commissioner for Human Rights of the
United Nations (UN), Michelle Bachelet.[^128] The UN draws attention to
people who are HIV positive in the LGBTQ+ community. In Brazil, HIV
among men who have sex with men is a reality classified as an
epidemic.[^129] Although they are not part of the risk group, they have
a specific health care routine and ongoing medical treatments that
require going out to withdraw retroviral drugs in health units. The UN
also reinforces the importance of the local authorities to ensure the
maintenance of these treatments and the continuous supply of HIV
medication during the pandemic, not allowing prejudices to affect access
and availability of essential drugs.

Other health issues raise worries when we are facing the dissemination
of a virus that attacks the respiratory system. Some studies show that
the LGBTQ+ population uses tobacco at rates 50% higher than the general
population.[^130] The community still has a significant number of people
with cancer and, consequently, a fragile immune system. It is important
to note that LGBTQ+ people are historically discriminated against by
both health employees and the health system. As a result, many are
reluctant to seek medical care, even in urgent situations. That can mean
a dire health risk in COVID-19 times.

Talking about employment issues in Brazil, a national survey conducted
by the group \#VoteLGBT and researchers from two major Brazilian
universities, points out that within the LGBTQ+ community, 22% of
respondents are unemployed and 21% have no income.[^131] This survey was
conducted through online questionnaires, therefore, it is possible that
it did not reach some of the most vulnerable people in the community. It
is also relevant to highlight difficulties in access to income by
transgender women who are sex workers, since 90% of the Brazilian trans
population uses prostitution as a source of income.[^132] In times of
social distancing, they can no longer conduct their business, and may
lose their source of income. Transphobia also does not cease during a
pandemic. Some Latin American countries have determined that social
distancing means that men and women only leave their houses on separate
days. There have been cases of trans women being fined for leaving their
home on the day designated for women, making the pandemic period even
more difficult for the trans population. In addition to fighting the
virus, they still must fight to reaffirm who they are.

Addressing the challenges of staying home during the pandemic and
finding a safe place to be protected, a global survey conducted by the
relationship app Hornet with gay and bisexual men found that 1 out of 3
men felt physically and emotionally insecure in their own homes.[^133]
The reasons were not only due to intrafamilial prejudice, but also the
loneliness of those living alone; Data from \#VoteLGBT's survey also
pointed out that 28% of the Brazilian respondents have been diagnosed
with depression, which worsened the scenario presented by Hornet's
survey.

Shelters (in Portuguese *Casas de Acolhimento*) are an alternative for
surviving for LGBTQ+ people who are unable to earn a living or who have
been kicked out of their families' homes. Although each has its
administration, they support each other on joint projects to collect
donations and carry out cultural actions. In addition to a shelter, they
provide food and personal hygiene products for marginalized people. They
also rely on donations and sponsorships to develop academic,
capacity-building, and cultural activities. During the pandemic, when
everything is more urgent and scarce, shelters have seen a decrease of
donations, while requests for shelter have increased.

### Initiatives to Cope with This Scenario {#initiatives-to-cope-with-this-scenario .BOOK_Heading-3}

Amid the plight that the LGBTQ+ community faces today, some initiatives
deserve particular support. They are the result of the mobilization of
the community, with support of LGBTQ-friendly companies and celebrities.
Regarding the shelters mentioned above, some fundraising initiatives
have managed to provide significant support to these institutions in
this time of crisis. A virtual live concert with a famous Brazilian DJ
organized by NGO Casinha---produced by Tenho Orgulho, FestivalUniverso,
and TODXS[^134]---raised more than 5,000 Brazilian Real (BRL) (ca. 750
EUR) for organizations such as Casa Nem, LGBT+ Movimento and Casainha.
Another virtual live concert titled Festival do Orgulho was organized by
Amstel Brewery and payment app AME. The Festival was headlined by
nationally-famous artists, including the singer and drag queen Pabllo
Vittar. It raised 115,000 BRL[^135] (over 17,000 EUR) for the
organizations Casa Florescer, Grupo Pela Vidda, Projeto Séfora's,
Família Stronger and Arco Íris de Ribeirão Preto.

Another fundraising initiative for shelters across the country was the
crowdfunded campaign run by All Out Brazil[^136] to support the
maintenance, purchase, and distribution of cleaning products, hygiene
materials, and food. The initiative raised approximately 54,000 BRL
(over 8,000 EUR) for CasAmor LGBTQI+ (Aracaju), Astra Human Rights and
LGBT Citizenship \| Acódi LGBT (Aracaju), Casa Transformar (Fortaleza),
Casa Miga Acolhimento LGBT+ (Manaus), Casa da Diversidade Niterói
(Niterói), Transviver (Recife), CasaNem (Rio de Janeiro), Casa Aurora
(Salvador), Casa dos Direitos da Baixada (São João de Meriti), Casa
Chama (São Paulo), Casa Florescer 1 (São Paulo) and Casa Florescer 2
(São Paulo).

Another initiative, linked to the arts, was created by \#VoteLGBT, the
same group that conducted the aforementioned survey. Created during
quarantine, LGBTFLIX[^137] is a free-access platform that compiles more
than 200 LGBTQ+ themed short films. This initiative brings entertainment
to the LGBTQ+ community during this period of social isolation. On the
platform, you can choose short films with homosexual, bisexual, or
transgender themes. Some nationwide initiatives are still ongoing and
accepting donations. One of them is The Emergency Fund for trans people
organized by Casa Chama in São Paulo, which has already raised 83,000
BRL (12,500 EUR).[^138]

These initiatives illuminate a path of light amid so many adversities.
They demonstrate the capacity of the LGBTQ+ community to unite to face
another major challenge with COVID-19. It is essential to understand the
reality of the LGBTQ+ community during this pandemic, to highlight what
has been already accomplished and call for people to support initiatives
on an ongoing basis. With prudence and responsibility, while following
scientific and WHO\`s guidelines, the COVID-19 pandemic will be
surpassed.

## The Dilemma of Making Undocumented Migrants Visible to COVID-19 Counting (Annalisa Pelizza, Yoren Lausberg & Stefania Milan) {#the-dilemma-of-making-undocumented-migrants-visible-to-covid-19-counting-annalisa-pelizza-yoren-lausberg-stefania-milan .BOOK_Heading-2}

On March 13, 2020, after announcing that Europe had become the epicenter
of the COVID-19 pandemic, World Health Organization's Executive Director
Dr. Michael Ryan made a plea to assist invisible populations. "We cannot
forget migrants, we cannot forget undocumented workers, we cannot forget
prisoners," he argued.[^139] In just a few days, civil societies around
the world discovered that invisibility is indeed a recurrent companion
to the virus. COVID-19 is exceptionally hard to contain due to its
asymptomatic contagion and long incubation period. It has also been hard
to classify as a cause of death, complicating the efforts to trace it
and count its victims.[^140] Despite narratives about its alleged
democratic character, the virus seems to decimate weak, invisible
populations the hardest. The elderly confined to care homes have been
decimated across Europe, and largely uncounted.[^141] From China to
Pennsylvania, the toll of people passing away in the solitude of their
homes or shelters does not appear in official statistics. Undocumented
migrants are also dying from the virus because they are too afraid to
seek help,[^142] so their numbers are typically not reflected in
official statistics. If today "being counted" is even more so a
condition of existence and care[^143], Western countries are failing to
account for the health conditions of these invisible populations. In the
days of COVID-19, what these dramatic missing numbers make apparent is
that invisibility may mean death.

The COVID-19 pandemic forces a dilemma about invisibilized populations,
and migrants in particular---one which has to do simultaneously with
societal and technological concerns. On one hand, visibility gaps are a
systemic aspect of population management that might be welcomed by
policy makers and populations. Indeed, the illusion of a "data
panopticon" does not account for the conditions of data collection, data
gaps, and the limits of system interoperability; not everyone is counted
in all systems, and not in the same way. Such invisibility serves the
needs of informal economies and unscrupulous politicians ready to
mobilize security concerns for their own goals. From housing insecure
people to the incarcerated, from migrants to sex workers, invisibility
can be deemed a protection from care that too often resembles control
and surveillance.[^144]

On the other hand, a surge in the visibility of migrant populations
might help curb the contagion and avoid COVID-19 spreading within
vulnerable populations. Indeed, being invisible translates into the
inability to access crucial services in the time of the pandemic,
particularly health care. Access to testing, medication, and treatment
requires insurance, and insurance demands people are countable. Even
when the costs of insurance can be offset by the collective, being
countable remains a key condition of access. In the US, for example, the
second coronavirus relief package known as the Families First
Coronavirus Response Act has extended testing to the Medicaid-eligible
population,[^145] even when uninsured, but not to undocumented migrants,
nor to other temporary residents.[^146]

We suggest that the current situation requires to reconsider the
relationship between data, populations and (in)visibility. Under which
conditions would including invisibilized populations in the general
COVID-19 count result in a just outcome? For sure, some precautions
should be heeded. Even in the best case scenario, instead of exposing
vulnerable populations, such reconsideration might even entail a de
facto form of civil inclusion. What follows makes the point by
considering migrants and undocumented populations as especially
vulnerable to COVID-19, due to their invisibilized status in official
registries and administration, and the barriers to formal and
professional care that their invisibility entails. While most of our
examples originate in the European continent, we believe that there is
something universal in this exercise that can also inform the way other
countries and communities relate to people in the move in pandemic
times.

### **People on the Move do not Show in COVID-19 Counts** {#people-on-the-move-do-not-show-in-covid-19-counts .BOOK_Heading-3}

In mid-April, António Vitorino, Director General of the International
Organization for Migration, recently called for a universal response to
COVID-19, regardless of migratory status.[^147] Portugal has
specifically addressed the migrant condition in its response to the
pandemic. It has extended access to the same services of the resident
population to third country nationals with pending applications:
national health care, welfare benefits, bank accounts, and work and
rental contracts.[^148] The Portuguese response constitutes a temporary
inclusion of foreign citizens, in the name of pragmatism and human
rights. Admittedly, this response is unique in a continent that has
halted most bureaucratic procedures and data processing involving people
on the move.

Sweden[^149], The Netherlands[^150], and Belgium[^151] have suspended
administrative services for migrants, refugees and asylum-seekers. After
halting asylum procedures, Greece has put migrants living in overcrowded
camps[^152] under quarantine.[^153] In Serbia, along the so-called
Balkan Route, armed forces have taken over the security of about 150
social welfare institutions, 120 medical facilities and 20 migrant
camps, locking migrants in.[^154] Similarly, Bosnia Herzegovina has
introduced tighter controls in the reception centres, so migrants and
refugees can no longer leave or enter.[^155] Italy has declared its
ports "unsecure",[^156] asylum and police offices are closed and data
processing suspended.[^157] Meanwhile, an estimated 200,000 undocumented
farmworkers in Italy live in cramped informal settlements in precarious
hygienic conditions without running water, which makes it impossible to
implement the social distancing and hygienic measures necessary to slow
the contagion. In France, many sleep in makeshift camps or on the
streets, and local nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) sound alarm
bells about an upcoming "health scandal", and question the government's
lack of adequate response.[^158] In the UK, NGOs point out that the
suspension of various support networks increasingly puts already
precarious people at risk, noting how the hostile environment deters
undocumented people from seeking help.[^159] In many European countries
migrants are not included in COVID-19 counts, hindering access to care
and relief systems. What are the consequences of this situation, and how
can it be rectified?

### **The Consequences of Invisibility** {#the-consequences-of-invisibility .BOOK_Heading-3}

The invisibility of moving populations in pandemic time can have health,
economic, and social consequences. First, we are seeing that its effects
stack on existing social and institutional inequalities.[^160]
Vulnerable populations are left behind when addressing the public health
threats of the coronavirus outbreak. As already hostile environments bar
mobile populations from seeking professional and official health care,
the spread and effects of the coronavirus will be exacerbated among
these populations. They are already vulnerable due to a lack of
accessible information and access to hygiene facilities, and also
because their economic vulnerability forces them to seek employment when
others can choose to stay at home. The exclusion of some people from
comprehensive efforts to counter the spread of COVID-19 will cause
harsher and more prolonged sanitary effects among these groups. These
effects will impact not only their well-being, but also the general
well-being of society at large, as failure to contain the virus will
exacerbate its spread.

Second, invisibility may exacerbate asymmetries in economy and labor
relations. Invisibility not only permits exploitation in agricultural
economies, construction work, and temporary job markets. It also marks a
harsh asymmetry between migrant workers' contribution to the COVID-19
response and their under-representation in statistics. For instance,
European countries like Austria and Germany are importing farmhands from
Eastern Europe to harvest seasonal vegetables like asparagus. The
Italian Minister of Agriculture Teresa Bellanova has recently proposed
to give some of the estimated 600,000 undocumented immigrants in the
country temporary work permits to plug the labor gap, which is large and
urgent in the agri-food sector.[^161] Yet counting, as well as rights
asymmetries, continue to permeate job sectors that are vital to the
COVID-19 response. Food delivery workers in European cities are largely
migrants who cannot afford to "stay home" and lose income.According to
the Migration Policy Institute, in the US, the foreign-born represent 38
% of home care and a significant share of workers in food production and
distribution, all sectors at the coronavirus response frontline.[^162]

Third, invisibility has societal consequences, because it fuels racism
and xenophobia. In Italy, for example, pseudoscientific myths are
spreading on social media, in a country where migration is often
associated with heterogeneous skin traits, and hospitalized patients are
largely white.[^163] Not only do these resurgent racialized explanations
of alleged immunity to the virus fuel racist narratives, they lack any
scientific base and disregard empirical evidence of African-American
communities tragically and disproportionally hit by the virus on the
other side of the Atlantic.[^164] They also reignite racial
classifications and genetic pseudoscientific thinking that assumed had
dissipated with nineteenth-century colonial anthropology. Furthermore,
they counteract socio-scientific explanations and consequent policy
action. If temporary residents are less rone to ask for support when
confronting COVID-19 symptoms, their reluctance might be due to their
tendency to associate the health care system with repressive
authorities, scarce linguistic skills and fragmented social
networks---all explanations that should be investigated in order to curb
the contagion.

### **Our Proposals for Just Visibility** {#our-proposals-for-just-visibility .BOOK_Heading-3}

All things considered, one might wonder whether the current emergency
requires reconsidering the relationship between data, visibility and
populations. Institutional solutions appear to timidly move in the
direction of making migrant populations more visible. In Italy, the
introduction of mandatory self-certification to exit home was sufficient
to halt the agricultural production chain, as work force is mainly
constituted by irregular migrants. As a result, the Italian Agriculture
Ministry is attempting to overcome the impasse by creating a new
registry of agricultural labor.[^165] US scholar and author Shoshana
Zuboff, a fierce critic of what she herself terms "surveillance
capitalism," in an interview with the Italian daily *La Repubblica*,
surprisingly argued that contact-tracing apps should be mandatory and
data should be managed by public bodies.[^166] But Zuboff's argument
falls short when it meets vulnerable populations who don't want to be
traced and are suspicious of authorities. Becoming visible through an
app of this kind clashes with the fears of repression and deportation
these vulnerable population live with.

The question becomes, how can visibility be *just*? The consequences of
invisibility we have identified do not exist in isolation, because forms
of invisibilization stack upon each other. As mentioned above, mobile
populations often work in already precarious and exploitative sectors,
which have suddenly become foregrounded as "essential" during the
pandemic. This creates the paradox that while the work is visibilized as
vital, the workers are barred from accessing civil rights, and are still
kept out of the count and thus excluded from aid and relief. It is then
crucial to consider what inclusion in the COVID-19 response is for; is
it a temporal visibilization in disease tracing and tracking, so that
people who have been immunized can return to orchards and elderly houses
to become invisibilized workers again? Or will access to civil rights be
granted on a permanent basis to all?

In facing the visibility/invisibility dilemma for populations on the
move, diverse scenarios open up, from repressive authorities identifying
and tracking undocumented migrants, to a de facto form of civil
inclusion. De facto inclusion would entail universal access to civil
institutions such as health care, welfare and civil rights. It would be
an infrastructural (but nevertheless political) way to classify people
on the move as members of civil communities, while at the same time
protecting them through civil rights. De facto inclusion would entail
protected visibility. In what follows, we reflect on the conditions
under which the counting of invisibilized populations can lean towards
this second scenario.

We argue that a multi-pronged approach is needed to address the problem
of making the invisible population of migrants countable under fair
conditions. First, we need to carefully consider how we count and what
digital infrastructure we employ. For starters, counting should respect
the principles enshrined in the EU General Data Protection Regulation,
most notably data minimization (i.e., data collection should be limited
to what is necessary) and purpose limitation (i.e., data should be
collected for specific, explicit and legitimate purposes). But data
collection should also commit to fairness and transparency, meaning that
personal data should be processed transparently to data subjects, and
abide by democratic oversight and accountability. In other words, the
counting we propose should protect populations and the societies
surrounding them, rather than exclude, discriminate, or repress them. To
this end, we need to ensure that data collection and use are
discrimination- and future-proof. Data about, for example, health
conditions collected during the pandemic emergency should not be used
against these vulnerable populations at a later stage. In this process
of envisioning fair rules for counting vulnerable populations, the
infrastructural dimension should be given adequate consideration.
Although "invisible" in themselves, digital infrastructures---including
how they are designed, integrated, and owned---are an integral part of
any decision-making with regards to counting.

Second, civil rights for people on the move must also include the right
to be deleted from any database, and to not be traced beyond the
original goals (i.e., the purpose limitation mentioned in GDPR). Data
about people who have been on the move is already stored in systems of
identification and registration used at the border, with the risk of
carrying stigmas far and wide. On top of that, entering a health care or
welfare database often means being subjected to a system of invasive
cross checks. As many counts and registries are also modes of control
and surveillance, inclusion should also entail the right to be
forgotten. Furthermore, any restrictive or invasive measure should come
with adequate sunset provisions, whereby any data collection that is in
some way invasive of people's privacy can cease to have effect when a
vaccine becomes available and is widely administered.

Third, the practice of counting empowers the counter more than for the
counted, so we propose an alliance between different counting entities
rallying around the need for public critical care. These entities
include, migrant-led organizations, shelters, health care institutions,
unions, and local organizations. Our rallying cry comes with its own set
of challenges, including database interoperability issues and
principles, as various organizations will have to gather around a
concern for care and public health, while bringing their own experiences
and values. The alternative would leave us with a prolonged public
health crisis or empower state authorities and private corporations to
collect population data.

Finally, and most importantly, the counting we propose should take stock
of the European migration regime, and invert the priority given since
2015 to securitization at the expenses of health data. Our research
at [Processing Citizenship](http://processingcitizenship.eu/) has shown
that in European frontline countries, the assessment of health
conditions was originally the primary concern among people rescued at
sea upon disembarkation.[^167] However, with the so called "Hotspot
approach" introduced in 2015, priority has shifted to fill
administrative databases for security concerns.[^168] If anything,
COVID-19 is a powerful reminder of the need to restore the original
priority given to health data in population management. In sum, we argue
that identification and tracking of migrants for purely security
purposes should be replaced with health care assessment through
specialized, non-interoperable information systems that count resident
populations and those on the move.

To conclude, we cannot but note that the bulk of our
proposals---especially around data protection, data minimization,
purpose limitation, and sunset clauses---are also valid when considering
deploying contact-tracing apps for the general population. We wonder, to
what extent can any counting measure to contain the virus be effective
while distinguishing among populations? By considering how to fairly
include invisibilized populations in what is today's most pressing
count, we might end up realizing that even most classifications for
visible populations are being redefined. A more comprehensive solution
to this conundrum would be to include all residents of a given polity in
critical services, regardless of their status. If so, the challenge is
how to ensure that this redefinition is as inclusive as possible. This
might require changing the ways Europe sees its people and who these
people are, and ultimately, the role of data infrastructures in this
inclusive recounting.

## Disrupting "business as usual": COVID-19 and platform labour (Jelke Bosma, Eva Mos & Niels van Doorn) {#disrupting-business-as-usual-covid-19-and-platform-labour-jelke-bosma-eva-mos-niels-van-doorn .BOOK_Heading-2}

Things are bad right now and they will probably get worse in the future.
Once the global pandemic caused by COVID-19 is finally under control,
the afterlife of this public health crisis is likely to have a
devastating impact on our national and local economies for years to
come. But not everyone will be affected in the same way and to the same
extent. We have already witnessed how the pandemic has brought
long-standing inequalities with respect to income and wealth
distribution into sharp relief. Some social groups have access to the
resources (e.g. time, space, capital, influence) necessary to weather
this crisis, or even make a profit from it, while many others scramble
to protect their lives and livelihoods. In many ways, COVID-19
intensifies and accelerates these inequalities and will ultimately push
them to a breaking point, a point that even conservative governments
have been trying to steer clear of by introducing economic rescue plans.

Importantly, the ongoing platformization of labour and livelihoods
embodies a similar logic of intensification and acceleration. While the
term "disruption" has been overused---and poorly describes the economic
and social impacts that platforms like Uber, Airbnb, or Deliveroo are
having---we nevertheless think it is safe to say that these impacts are
significant. Platform companies are reorganizing how people work and
make a living, and how citizens and their governments manage and take
care of others. Emerging in the wake of the 2008 recession, they have
exacerbated the unequal distribution of opportunities and risks along
lines of class, gender, race, and nationality---even when they claim to
empower working people.

Over the past few weeks it has become clear that things are no longer
'business as usual' for these companies, as they are not only facing new
challenges but seizing opportunities that have arisen from the current
crisis. Meanwhile, we are seeing new local platform-based initiatives
springing up, driven by networks of citizens as well as private
organizations aiming to assist the most vulnerable members of their
communities.

Various news outlets have reported that the popularity of on-demand
delivery services has grown massively in cities across the globe,
especially in large metropolitan areas now dealing with increasingly
severe lockdowns.[^169] In New York City, for instance, couriers for
food delivery platforms like *DoorDash* and *Caviar* are facing an
ambivalent situation. Whilst workers realize that their services are
more needed than ever, at the same time they are worried about their
health and safety because these platform companies offer no proper
protections or insurances to independent contractors.[^170] While many
workers take pride in their job and half-jokingly praise the empty
streets in Manhattan, they also feel they should not have to invest in
protective gear. Quite a few couriers warn that social distancing is
often impossible when waiting at a restaurant with other delivery
workers.

Although most delivery companies have by now arranged their own
financial assistance programs for couriers who get infected or are
required to self-quarantine, these initiatives generally offer relief up
to just 14 days and require them to submit documentation that is
difficult to obtainin times of crisis.[^171] With such high application
thresholds, it is unclear how many couriers have gained access to these
emergency funds, which appear to be little more than a public relations
strategy.

Beyond these limited reactive measures, which force couriers to keep
working until they are physically or legally unable to work, companies
like *Uber*, *DoorDash*, and *Deliveroo* continue to disavow
responsibility for their workforce by fighting reclassification
legislation that would force them to provide a more comprehensive safety
net. Instead, *Uber*'s CEO has recently petitioned the US Federal
government to step in and provide the protections America's new first
responders now need more than ever.[^172] In fact, he recently got what
he wanted, which may have negative implications in the future.

The abovementioned companies, in tandem with *Amazon*, are primarily
focused on expanding their delivery markets by further rolling out and
diversifying their outsourced logistical services. NYC's ride-hailing
industry is taking a big hit due to COVID-19, which is also wreaking
havoc on the restaurant and hospitality industry.[^173] In response,
drivers and restaurant workers are turning to delivery platforms to
salvage part of their income, while Uber and Amazon are exploring the
possibility of delivering test kits in the near future.[^174] *Uber* and
*Lyft* are also trying to capitalize on an increased need for the
private transportation of vulnerable people and critical goods through
their Uber Health and LyftUp initiatives, respectively.[^175]

Meanwhile, *DoorDash* is partnering with NYC's government to deliver
food to "medically fragile students," and has also launched a "package
of commission relief and marketing support" for new and existing partner
restaurants.[^176] *DoorDash* is investing heavily in COVID-induced
market growth. The company allows new restaurants to sign up for free
and pay no commissions for 30 days, and it creates priority access for
restaurant workers looking to start as Dashers. Across the Atlantic, the
situation in Amsterdam and Berlin looks a bit different. While delivery
companies in these cities are also signing up scores of restaurants that
have had to close their doors to dining customers, couriers working for
*Deliveroo*, *TakeAway*, and/or *Uber Eats* are not yet seeing a
similarly high boost in orders. Neither are they getting the tips or
bonus incentives one may hope for during this crisis.

In Amsterdam, couriers who have a financial buffer are staying home as
much as possible, particularly students for whom the pay-outs are not
worth the risk. Still, the streets continue to fill with food delivery
workers, many of whom are immigrants with little choice but to keep
working regardless of how bad the circumstances get. Other sources of
income have mostly been discontinued and, like their peers in NYC, they
are only receiving standard emails and notifications from platform
companies warning them to keep their distance and fulfil the logistical
promise of contact-free delivery. That this promise is a fantasy becomes
painfully clear when picking up an order at an otherwise closed
McDonald's restaurant, where more than a handful of waiting couriers
converge around the door each time it opens wide enough to push the next
bag of fast food through.

Another thing we are not yet seeing in European cities is the kind of
crisis-driven service diversification and public-private partnerships
that platform companies are currently experimenting with in the US This
might soon change, however, as *Deliveroo*, *JustEat*, and *Uber* are
allegedly all in conversation with the British Government about
providing delivery support to elderly and vulnerable people.[^177] Due
to the conjunction of an increased public need for logistical solutions
and a decreased demand for ride-hailing services across Europe, *Uber*
may be looking for similar ways to reallocate its drivers in other
countries.

Ride-hailing is not the only segment of the gig economy to be negatively
impacted by COVID-19. Due to mandatory social distancing and home
quarantine measures, domestic cleaners working through platforms such as
*Handy* and *Helpling* are losing most of their income. In the
Netherlands, for instance, *Helpling* bookings are down 40% and the
cancellation rate is expected to rise to 50-60%.[^178] Cleaners in
Amsterdam---mostly immigrants---are facing difficult times, since most
of their clients have asked them to stay away until further notice. One
cleaner said she lost about 1,200 euros over the last two weeks and is
now fully dependent on her partner's income. When asked whether she had
checked her eligibility for financial assistance---which the Dutch
government recently made available to independent contractors hit by the
COVID-19 crisis---she admitted having no idea such a rescue program
existed, let alone if she would qualify. Her response highlights the
vulnerability of migrant gig workers, who often do not master the native
language and have trouble accessing information pertinent to their
livelihood. Even when access is obtained, navigating the red tape in a
foreign bureaucracy can be exceedingly difficult.

In conclusion, the pandemic is impacting the gig economy in two
significant ways. First, it accelerates the ascendency of on-demand
delivery as the dominant and most rapidly expanding service market, at
the expense of ride-hailing and domestic cleaning. Secondly, it
intensifies gig platforms' experimentation with public-private
partnerships and forms of service provision that cater to special needs
populations. By seeking new ways to support the social reproduction of
vulnerable consumer groups during a time of crisis, while continuing to
discard the reproductive struggles of their workforce, platform
companies are leveraging this public health crisis in a bid to become
increasingly infrastructural. That is, COVID-19 generates a state of
exception that offers companies a window of opportunity to test-drive
their desired scenario of becoming privatized digital utilities that
control and monetize critical data flows.[^179] The question that
remains is, to what extent will this state of exception become the rule?

## The Role of a Gig-Worker During Crisis: Consequences of COVID-19 on Food Delivery Workers in South India (Shyam Krishna) {#the-role-of-a-gig-worker-during-crisis-consequences-of-covid-19-on-food-delivery-workers-in-south-india-shyam-krishna .BOOK_Heading-2}

As the COVID-19 crisis unfolds in India, it is clear that the country's
largely informal workforce is facing the brunt of the impact. The
workers in the growing Indian gig-economy, particularly food-delivery
workers, are heavily affected. Confronting severely reduced income, they
face the danger of possible exposure to infection during their daily
work. In the early part of this year as the impact of COVID-19 was
barely surfacing globally, I was working as a food delivery worker in
south India while conducting a self-ethnographic research project.[^180]
Based on both my experience working in food delivery and my continuing
engagement with workers who are currently active, in this chapter I
explore the impact on the gig-workers, and reflect on some of the
consequences of the crisis.

Even in normal times, food delivery workers assume enormous risk on
behalf of both restaurants and the customers. They are constantly
exposed to risks such as dangerous road traffic and harsh weather
conditions. These risks have been compounded by the current crisis, in
which some measures taken to protect the general public adversely affect
the workers. Under isolation efforts, safety is paramount, and
'contactless' deliveries[^181] are becoming the norm. But this means
that the workers themselves continue to take on risk during this crisis
and are seen by companies and governments as a potential solution for
delivering help to those affected by COVID-19. In these extraordinary
times, the government has also encouraged the'citizen' use[^182] of food
delivery platforms. Both as a rhetoric and as a policy, this is a
problematic nexus between the state and digital platforms that neglects
to support workers. The unfortunate counterintuitive impact of
governmental controls, such as lowering the number of operating hours
for restaurants and shops, is that without due protection, such controls
force the food delivery workers to queue up in the short time the busy
locations operate. This heightens the workers' risk of social contact
and infections, which they shoulder for customers. One of the workers I
interviewed sums this dynamic up by saying that this crisis highlights
the absence of actual care and accountability for the workers that was
expected of digital platforms and the state. They report that efforts
taken to provide personal protective equipment to workers are
inadequate. Many reportedly continue to purchase their own masks and
gloves. Such efforts to improve worker safety have not been made
mandatory or provisioned by the state, and similar stories are emerging
from cities across India.[^183]

Food delivery workers report that the 60% reduction in volume of orders
reported on food delivery platforms has greatly reduced their
income.[^184] On top of unfair work conditions, the workers report that
platforms continue to control them algorithmically by imposing daily
targets with lowered rewards, forcing the few active workers to embark
on longer delivery trips.[^185] These trips may now be of more than 10
kms, double their driving distance during normal times. But now, riding
across the city on a scooter also means navigating road blockades and
encountering police, with whom interactions can be very risky.[^186]
Further, in responding to the current crisis, digital platforms,
encouraged by the government, have taken to introducing or ramping up
delivery of medicines and groceries using the same set of workers.[^187]
These newer services are both untested and demand increased effort from
workers, who continue to be compensated only at the same level as for
regular food delivery. As one worker mentions, queuing up and picking up
groceries can take 2 hours, but they are paid the same as a food order
delivery that used to take as little as 15 minutes. Especially in a
crisis, this situation is ripe for state intervention to impose the
digital platforms to guarantee a "per hour pay" structure for these
workers and with mandated perks for additional risk efforts like
queueing up and long-distance rides.

While a structured response that guarantees pay and protection to
workers is still yet to be announced, digital platforms have resorted to
donation- or charity-driven responses, even as they seek governmental
bailout.[^188] The largesse of the platforms is performed by asking the
customers to provide tips and donations to affected workers. Funds are
also collected by platforms which are raised by future facing
subscriptions that lock customers to platforms. In either case, the
commercial nature of the platform and the relationship of these workers
to the platforms does not see any intervention. In fact, the workers
feel efforts such as ramping up subscription services, introducing
grocery deliveries without changing the pay, and efforts of charity
meant for workers will only ensure the commercial future of the
platforms and not the future of the workers themselves. They point to
actions such as the platforms deducting money for loan repayments even
amidst these extraordinary times as evidence digital platforms and their
pay structure continue to be extractive. Because these loans are
governed by private sector partnership contracts, they fall under a
regulatory void. For example, the response to COVID-19 by the Indian
governmentonly mandates deferment being granted on repayments schedules
for loans given by many public entities.[^189] 

Ultimately, the absence of regulation within the gig-economy,
particularly its labour practices during the COVID-19 crisis, is
compounded by efforts of the state and digital platforms that do not go
far enough to help workers. This leaves the gig-worker to be treated as
a general-purpose solution for supporting the local community, even when
their own livelihood is left to be governed by extractive terms set by
digital platforms and their marketisation efforts. In the absence of any
state-mandated social safety, such as employment protection and
guaranteed wages, gig-­workers face an unfortunate choice of either
depending on charity or placing themselves at risk. The state continues
to engage with digital platforms either as a utility provider for
last-mile logistics, or as if they were a charity. Their response
ignores the actual responsibility of the platforms as employers, and
signals a need to question the underlying assumptions of the gig-economy
and the way it treats an already vulnerable workforce who have now
become first responders to the COVID-19 crisis.

## Gerenciando Incertezas às Próprias Custas: Motoristas Uber sob a Pandemia no Brasil (Ana Guerra) {#gerenciando-incertezas-às-próprias-custas-motoristas-uber-sob-a-pandemia-no-brasil-ana-guerra .BOOK_Heading-2}

***Managing Uncertainties at Your own Cost: Brazilian Uber Drivers in
the Pandemic***

*Brazil has rapidly become a hotspot for COVID-19. Brazilian Uber
drivers must now choose between putting their well-being at risk and
giving up their main source of income. But is there anything new about
this difficult trade-off? We interviewed three Uber drivers in Belo
Horizonte to understand how they have responded to the pandemic.*

O Brasil é o maior mercado da Uber fora dos Estados Unidos, com mais de
um milhão de "parceiros". Recentemente, o país bateu outro recorde como
a pior eclosão de COVID-19 no mundo depois dos Estados Unidos, com
772.416 casos confirmados e mais de 39.000 mortes até 11 de junho.[^190]
Este artigo explora o impacto da pandemia em uma população social e
economicamente marginalizada: motoristas Uber. Ele traz à tona
preocupações que povoam seu cotidiano enquanto circulam pelas ruas de
Belo Horizonte, a sexta cidade mais populosa do Brasil.

### Por Dentro dos Modelos Preditivos da Uber {#por-dentro-dos-modelos-preditivos-da-uber .BOOK_Heading-3}

A plataforma transnacional, que opera em 63 mercados nacionais pelo
mundo, é conhecida como um exemplo da economia sob-demanda, ou "economia
de bicos". Se por um lado ela confere um certo grau de independência aos
trabalhadores, por outro, não os fornece estabilidade ou qualquer tipo
de proteção. Trabalhando sob um regime de trabalho altamente datificado
os motoristas se veem em meio a rotinas exaustivas e privados de
direitos trabalhistas, já que não são classificados como empregados
formais.

Como esse modelo funciona? A plataforma emprega uma série de técnicas de
gerenciamento algorítmico da força de trabalho dos motoristas a partir
da combinação entre um ideal de livre mercado autorregulado e análise
preditiva, o que costuma ser apresentado como um modo de minimizar
incertezas e ajudar os motoristas a tomarem decisões mais lucrativa. Tal
modelo só se torna possível graças à contínua coleta e processamento de
dados sobre padrões de trânsito e localização e comportamentos de
passageiros e motoristas. Os esforços tanto de desenvolvimento, quanto
retóricos da empresa evidenciam a ambição de gerenciar e mitigar
incertezas. Isso é ilustrado pelas soluções de forecasting da
plataformas, voltadas para a predição e o gerenciamento das dinâmicas
espaço-temporais do que é chamado de "mundo real", conforme é visível em
publicações no blog de engenharia da Uber e em aplicações de patente,
por exemplo.[^191] O desejo de antecipar dinâmicas futuras por meio de
dados também é evidenciada pelo que Rosenblat and Stark chamam "trabalho
algorítmico" dos motoristas Uber.[^192]

A Uber é um caso paradigmático de precarização do trabalho pelo que é
conhecido como "economia de bicos" ou "economia de compartilhamento". De
certa forma, não surpreende que este processo seja frequentemente
chamado de "uberização do trabalho". A incorporação de modelos
preditivos à rotina dos motoristas reverbera o que Adrian Mackenzie
identifica como uma generalização da predição na vida cotidiana, ou
seja, a presença crescente da ordenação algorítmica de preferências e
recomendações, reconhecimento de padrões e previsão de demanda voltados
à estabilização de resultados e ações futuros.[^193]

A mistura perigosa de performances datificadas, precarização e
informalização do trabalho, e pobreza é particularmente tóxica durante
uma pandemia que vem se caracterizando pela incerteza que impregna todas
as esferas da vida social.

### Gerenciando a Incerteza em uma Pandemia {#gerenciando-a-incerteza-em-uma-pandemia .BOOK_Heading-3}

Desde que a COVID-19 passou a tomar conta dos nossos pensamentos e
afetos, o mundo real parece estar se tornando ainda mais real, e nossa
relação com a predição, um pouco mais íntima. O mundo como o conhecemos
está se transformando rapidamente, e às vezes é difícil acompanhar os
números que nos dizem o que está acontecendo hoje e o que esperar do
amanhã: quantos casos? Quantos mortos? Quantos dias até voltarmos ao
"normal"? A resposta muda dia após dia. O novo coronavírus distorceu
nossa experiência de tempo e espaço. Um agente invisível, que podemos ou
não estar carregando dentro de nossas células ou na superfície de nossas
roupas, rapidamente perturbou as referências sólidas em torno das quais
nos acostumamos a organizar nossas rotinas Enquanto uma ampla variedade
de dados, modelos preditivos, projeções e representações visuais tentam
tornar seus efeitos um pouco mais inteligíveis, o desconhecido continua
encontrando modos de nos confrontar por ângulos inesperados. Qualquer
lampejo de certeza rapidamente se prova efêmero e nenhuma projeção ou
infográfico animado dá conta de amenizar isso. De certa forma, nossa
narrativa dataísta que privilegia ideais de verdade datificados e
orientados para a predição é progressivamente desestabilizada. A noção
de "dataísmo", como explica José van Dijck, é oriunda de uma crença na
"objetividade da quantificação" potencializada pela datificação do
comportamento e da socialidade humana em plataformas de mídias
digitais.[^194] É verdade que continuamos contando---contando pacientes,
contando leitos, contando corpos, contando os dias---mas nosso ritmo
mudou.

Apesar da sensação globalizada de incerteza, alguns lugares parecem mais
incertos do que outros. Aqui no Brasil, o novo epicentro da COVID-19, o
"mundo real" encontra pitadas de realismo fantástico.[^195] Entre
subnotificações, falta de testes, infindáveis conflitos entre os
posicionamentos de autoridades de saúde e os do presidente Jair
Bolsonaro[^196], notícias sobre valas coletivas[^197] e notícias falsas
sobre caixões cheios de pedra[^198], os brasileiros se vêem em um
cenário no mínimo caótico. Enquanto isso, o número de mortes segue
aumentando à medida que as camadas mais pobres da população são afetadas
pelo vírus e por um sistema econômico e social colapsado.

Entre aqueles apanhados pelo desamparo estão muitos dos
motoristas Uber no Brasil. O país é o segundo maior mercado da Uber fora
dos Estados Unidos. Desde que chegou por aqui em 2014, a plataforma
rapidamente se posicionou como uma solução de mobilidade para
comunidades mais pobres e menos assistidas pelo transporte público,
forjando um papel quase infraestrutural. Ela chega onde muitos taxistas
se recusam a ir e onde o transporte público é deficitário, como em
favelas e periferias. Além disso, "pegar um uber" pode ser mais tão
barato quanto pegar um ônibus, e, em geral, muito mais rápido. Para além
disso, a Uber também sustenta uma posição ambígua e privilegiada como
uma salvadora em meio a altas taxas de desemprego, e muitos motoristas
dependem da plataforma como principal fonte de renda. Neste momento, no
entanto, os motoristas são forçados a desacelerar. Alguns relatam uma
queda de 90% no movimento no movimento.[^199]

### Lidando com Tempos Incertos: Respostas da Uber vs. Experiências dos Motoristas {#lidando-com-tempos-incertos-respostas-da-uber-vs.-experiências-dos-motoristas .BOOK_Heading-3}

As respostas da Uber à pandemia fazem pouco para apaziguar a sensação de
incerteza. Dentro do pacote de "recursos"[^200] direcionado a motoristas
brasileiros, a plataforma anunciou um "auxilio financeiro"[^201] com
duração de até 14 dias para "parceiros" diagnosticados com COVID-19 ou
classificados como casos suspeitos ou parte de grupos de risco. Sua
elegibilidade deve ser atestada por documentos oficiais de autoridades
de saúde contendo informações detalhadas. A assistência não tem um valor
fixo, comum a todos os motoristas assistidos. Ao invés disso, a quantia
a ser recebida é calculada com base nos rendimentos médios do motorista
nos últimos três meses, estando intimamente vinculada à performance
individual de cada um. A própria política que informa a assistência é
efêmera e, parece incerta e de curto prazo, já que a plataforma indica
que podem ser atualizadas em pouco tempo. As regras descritas acima
foram atualizadas no dia 17 de abril e eram válidas até o dia 8 de maio,
tendo sido posteriormente estendidas até o dia 8 de junho. Tudo isso é
exacerbado pelo tratamento paradoxal da noção de "risco". Quando um
motorista solicita a assistência, sua conta é automaticamente
desativada, por motivos de segurança. Isso não garante, no entanto, que
ele será contemplado com tal assistência. O motorista é assim colocado
em uma posição dúbia: ao mesmo tempo em que ele representa um risco, e
portanto não pode trabalhar, ele não está em risco, e, por isso, não
receberá nenhuma assistência.

Para conhecer melhor a perspectiva dos motoristas, entrevistei Giacomo,
Antônio e Verón, três motoristas que trabalham na região metropolitana
de Belo Horizonte, cidade populosa com mais de 2.5 milhões de habitantes
e capital do estado de Minas Gerais. Também analisei mais de 50
comentários deixados em uma postagem no
[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/post/UgyCguPupYd-gpJ2VO14AaABCQ)
publicada por Samuel, um motorista e YouTuber que compartilhou minhas
perguntas com seus seguidores.[^202] No momento da escrita deste artigo,
todos os três entrevistados continuam trabalhando. Enquanto dirigem, o
Sars-Cov-2 pode estar dando uma volta em seu banco de trás, um risco
agravado pelo falta de cuidado de alguns passageiros. Giacomo estima que
de dez passageiros por ele transportados, dois teriam usado máscara. A
esposa de Antônio é diabética, grupo de risco para a COVID-19. Ela
precisa de uma dieta balanceada, e ele decidiu continuar trabalhando
para que possam pagar por isso. Para se proteger, comprou máscaras e
álcool em gel, e embora pudesse requerer um único reembolso no valor de
R\$20,00 oferecido pela Uber para aquisição de produtos de higiene, ele
se optou por não fazê-lo. "Uma ajuda irrisória", diz o entrevistado, "é
um desaforo". Os motoristas compartilham a sensação de que o movimento
se afrouxou, o que significa ficar algumas horas parado dentro do carro
esperando (e, portanto, "sem ganhar"). O trabalho ficou um pouco mais
solitário. Após ter o filho de 19 anos assassinado, Verón relata ter
ficado parado por mais de dois anos, "e aí eu conheci os aplicativos".
Desde então, ele vê dirigir para a Uber como um tipo de terapia e uma
oportunidade para conhecer novas pessoas. Ele nota que desde o início da
pandemia, os passageiros se tornaram menos inclinados a conversar
durante as corridas.

A maior parte dos motoristas que responderam à postagem de Samuel parece
terem desistido de dirigir por enquanto. Medo e segurança figuram como
as principais razões para isso: "eu já andava com medo antes, imagina
agora", escreve um deles. Trabalhando ou não, os motoristas logo
sentiram as consequências financeiras da pandemia. Muitos estão
devolvendo os carros alugados (cerca de 160 mil, segundo informações de
locadoras).[^203] Outros ainda não sabem como pagarão a próxima parcela
do veículo que comparam precisamente para trabalharem como motoristas de
aplicativo. Muitos recorreram ao auxílio emergencial do governo, no
valor de R\$ 600,00 mensais. Algumas das solicitações foram aceitas,
outras recusadas. A maioria dos motoristas segue encarando a mensagem
"em análise" na tela de seus celulares e computadores, acompanhada da
recomendação ambígua, com doses de cinismo, para "tentar novamente
amanhã" --- alguns deles vem "tentando novamente amanhã" há mais de um
mês. Quanto à assistência da Uber, a grande parte dos motoristas não é
elegível. Prevalece um sentimento geral de descrédito na "mãe Uber",
como alguns costumam se referir à plataforma, por vezes ironicamente,
mas nem sempre: "a Uber não faz nada por nós".

### Mas há Algo Realmente sob o Sol? {#mas-há-algo-realmente-sob-o-sol .BOOK_Heading-3}

Quando lhes peço para descrever o atual momento em uma palavra,
motoristas transitam entre "incerteza", "medo", "frustração" e
"resiliência", "perseverança", "aprendizado". Mas o que isso significa?
Seriam estes sentimentos novos? Olhar para como a pandemia afetou
motoristas Uber pode ser mais produtivo pelo que ela torna visível do
que pelo que traz de novo. As circunstâncias em que nos encontramos nos
convidam a desfamiliarizar um estado de precariedade recentemente
atualizado, mas há muito naturalizado. Como sugere Judith Butler, quando
perguntamos sobre as condições dos motoristas Uber sob a pandemia, "nós
também estamos perguntando sobre as condições de vida e morte que
sustentam a organização social do trabalho".

A incerteza não é nenhuma novidade. Tanto quanto estão acostumados a
serem "contados" --- trabalhando sob um regime altamente datificado,
sendo continuamente atrelados às métricas de suas performances--- os
motoristas Uber também estão acostumados a contabilizar. Tentar estimar
seus ganhos diários enquanto lidam com a taxa de serviço variável
cobrada pela Uber ao fim de cada corrida, calcular gastos com
combustível e manutenção, planejar o pagamento do aluguel ou das
parcelas do carro, tudo isso é parte de sua rotina. Eles também dedicam
tempo e energia à criação de estratégias e metas para otimizar sua
produtividade. A vida como motorista Uber é marcada por uma orientação
precária de à preditibilidade de curto prazo, enquanto o futuro continua
obscuro.

Quando trazemos o risco de volta à equação, as condições de vida e morte
se tornam ainda mais evidentes. Butler pergunta: "Quem arrisca vida
enquanto trabalha? Quem trabalha até morrer?". "Trabalhar até morrer" é
uma metáfora um tanto comum para os motoristas. Como um dito motorista
que entrevistei em 2018, pouco tempo após um dano causado a seu carro o
impedir de trabalhar por mais de 20 dias, "agora é a hora que eu entro
na Uber pra gastar. Enquanto o corpo aguentar, eu vou indo".
Infelizmente, a presença da morte vai além da metáfora. O medo da
violência é um forte componente de experiência compartilhada dos
motoristas que se veem vulneráveis a assaltos, sequestros e
assassinatos.[^204] Não é raro nos depararmos com notícias sobre corpos
de motoristas Uber encontrados algum tempo depois de serem reportados
como desaparecidos.

Assim, enquanto o modelo de negócios e o desenvolvimento tecnológico da
Uber gira em torno da mitigação de incertezas por meio de processamento
de dados e modelos preditivos, os motoristas, por outro lado, estão
bastante acostumados a gerenciar incertezas às próprias custas. A
diferença reside na escala. A Uber quer estabilizar o mundo real, prever
a demanda, gerenciar o trabalho e racionalizar a dinâmica das cidades
pelo mundo. No caso dos motoristas, a incerteza os atinge ainda mais de
perto. Trata-se de pagar as contas do mês e sobreviver por mais um dia.
Trata-se de sentimentos de medo, desamparo, esperança, resiliência,
orgulho e cansaço.

Já faz tempo que os motoristas estão cientes de como a precariedade
constitui seu cotidiano, e lutam para fazer a diferença, organizando-se
em associações, organizando protestos e buscando conversa e tanto com
representantes do poder público, quanto levando propostas à propria
Uber. Tarifas mais altas e mais segurança estão no topo de sua lista de
demandas. Por enquanto, não enxergam nenhum sinal de melhores condições
no horizonte do retorno à "normalidade". Alguns argumentam que este é,
na verdade, o momento certo para fazerem com que suas vozes sejam
escutadas --- "mas tem gente que é cega e continua trabalhando se
arriscando por esmolas", lamenta um motorista na publicação de Samuel.
Enquanto a incerteza se agiganta, a urgência parece falar mais alto. Ao
Perguntar a Giacomo qual a maior necessidade dos motoristas no momento,
sem hesitação, ele esclarece: "o que precisamos é de corridas.
Precisamos de corridas".

## COVID-19 and its Impact on Marginalised Communities in Singapore, South Korea, Indonesia, and the Philippines (Irene Poetranto & Justin Lau) {#covid-19-and-its-impact-on-marginalised-communities-in-singapore-south-korea-indonesia-and-the-philippines-irene-poetranto-justin-lau .BOOK_Heading-2}

Countries around the world have taken different steps to mitigate the
spread of COVID-19. The more developed economies of Singapore and South
Korea have utilized technology to help trace, test, and isolate cases at
a greater extent compared to emerging economies like Indonesia and the
Philippines. Even though variations in measures undertaken exist, they
share one thing in common: a disproportionate impact on marginalised
groups. This article examines COVID-19 strategies implemented by these
countries, and outlines their consequences on vulnerable groups,
including migrant workers, the LGBT community, and rural and Indigenous
peoples.

### **Outbreak Among Singapore's Migrant Workers** {#outbreak-among-singapores-migrant-workers .BOOK_Heading-3}

With only 266 cases and zero deaths by March 2020, Singapore was seen as
a model for other countries to follow in responding to the COVID-19
pandemic.[^205] Its success in curbing the coronavirus' spread was
attributed to lessons-learned from the 2003 Severe Acute Respiratory
Syndrome (SARS) outbreak[^206] and the fact that the city-state is
technologically advanced. The Singaporean government launched an
app[^207] to determine if potential carriers of the coronavirus have
been in close proximity with other people, used a robot "dog"[^208] to
patrol parks and ensure physical distancing, implemented a digital
check-in system[^209], and is giving out wearable tracking devices for
reporting health conditions and tracing proximity between users.[^210]

Despite its high-tech profile, Singapore's exceptionalism ended in early
May 2020 when 23,000 COVID-19 cases were reported---90% of which were
linked to crowded migrant workers' dormitories.[^211] Researchers and
activists had warned for years that low-wage migrant workers, who play
an integral role in Singapore's booming economy but live on the fringes
of society in precarious conditions, suffer disproportionately from
environmental, health, and safety risks.[^212] Yet they were largely
ignored until COVID-19 cases spread rampantly.[^213] This development
revealed the dangers of overlooking marginalised groups during a health
crisis. Singapore is now seen once again as a model, only this time for
other countries not to follow.

### **The Itaewon Cluster and South Korea's Anti-Gay Backlash** {#the-itaewon-cluster-and-south-koreas-anti-gay-backlash .BOOK_Heading-3}

The backlash against South Korea's LGBT community also illustrates the
impact of COVID-19 on marginalised groups that are vulnerable to
discrimination. South Korea uses a contact tracing regime that involves
surveillance camera footage, cell phone location data, GPS tracking from
both cars and phones, QR code entry logs, and credit card purchase
records.[^214] But as part of tracing efforts, it has disclosed online
the personal information of COVID-19 patients, including age, gender,
nationality, and occupation, which are also sent to residents via cell
phone alerts.[^215]

[Online
attacks](https://www.hrw.org/news/2020/05/13/covid-19-backlash-targets-lgbt-people-south-korea)
and [offline
harassment](https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/nation/2020/05/119_289498.html)[^216]
against LGBT persons increased when COVID-19 cases that resulted from a
man who visited nightspots in Seoul's Itaewon district, including
several popular in the gay community, were made public.[^217] Contact
tracing in this instance was also problematic, as people in this
conservative country were afraid to be associated with the LGBT
community or to have their sexuality outed, or both.[^218] [Excessive
disclosure](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2020.00305/full)
of personal information combined with stigma around LGBT issues may
prevent individuals exposed to the virus from getting tested, which
compromises public health measures.[^219]

### **Health and Security Concerns in Papua** {#health-and-security-concerns-in-papua .BOOK_Heading-3}

The impact of COVID-19 is even more pronounced for marginalised
communities with inadequate healthcare services. Indonesia's Papua
region is double the size of Great Britain with roughly four million
people, yet only has five hospitals designated to treat COVID-19
patients, and only two isolation rooms available that meet the World
Health Organization's standards.[^220] More than 300 of its Indigenous
tribes have small populations, which are threatened with extinction when
faced with a pandemic.[^221] Papuans lack access to clean water and
basic healthcare even though the largest copper and gold mine in the
world, called "Grasberg," is in their resource-rich territory. Run by
the US-based mining company Freeport-McMoran, Grasberg, like other
mines, initially did not restrict operations even as workers tested
positive for the coronavirus. Mine sites have thus become a vector for
the spread of COVID-19, with the risk of infecting local communities and
Indigenous peoples.[^222] When Grasberg became one of Papua's worst
COVID-19 clusters with 150 cases in mid-May, it finally reduced its
workforce size to prevent further infections.[^223]

The conflict in Papua complicates the COVID-19 response. The Netherlands
controlled Papua until 1962 and Papua was temporarily transferred to
Indonesia until an act of "self-determination" was completed.
Approximately 1,000 Indonesian government-selected participants voted in
the referendum, who unanimously opted for Papua to remain with
Indonesia. The illegitimacy of the vote, the often violent and arbitrary
crackdowns by Indonesian security forces, as well as media restrictions
and internet shutdowns help explain Papuans' demands for secession. This
conflict has been ongoing for over five decades, and in May 2020, an
armed group allegedly shot members of a local COVID-19 response
team.[^224]

### **Mining Operations in the Philippines** {#mining-operations-in-the-philippines .BOOK_Heading-3}

Resource-rich areas in the Philippines are also increasingly under
threat. Considered the most dangerous place in the world for land and
environmental defenders, the Philippines had the highest number of
murdered defenders of any country in 2018 and environmental protection
remains challenging.[^225] The Nueva Vizcaya Province, for example, is
the site of a dispute with a mining company, OceanaGold, a
Canadian-Australian public company that has been accused of human rights
violations.[^226] OceanaGold's permit to run the gold and copper mine
known as "Didipio" had expired in June 2019. The local government wants
the mine shut due to environmental concerns, yet it continues to
operate.[^227]

In April 2020, locals opposed to the Didipio mine erected a "peoples'
barricade," but they were violently dispersed by the police for
violating COVID-19 lockdown measures.[^228] Meanwhile, despite a
province-wide lockdown covering Homonhon Island, the central government
allowed a China-bound ship to dock there to load chromite ore.[^229]
This incident was in defiance of local authorities who denied its entry
for fear of COVID-19 infections, as Homonhon has no health facility, no
sea ambulance, and no functioning community hospital.

### **Similarities and Differences Between the Four Countries** {#similarities-and-differences-between-the-four-countries .BOOK_Heading-3}

Singapore, South Korea, Indonesia, and the Philippines have faced
different challenges in responding to the pandemic, but they share
commonalities. Singapore's and South Korea's technologically-driven
solutions have sparked national and global debates on balancing public
health and the right to privacy. Singapore's launch of a wearable device
that may be issued to every resident has resulted in fears of
surveillance and privacy violations. South Korea's pervasive collection
of personal data has also surfaced privacy concerns and social stigma
concerns that are feared more than the disease itself.[^230]

Unlike Singapore and South Korea, Indonesia and the Philippines have
weak healthcare systems and rely on security-heavy strategies.
Indonesia's COVID-19 task force chief[^231] is an Army lieutenant
general and the Indonesian military and police have been ordered to
enforce physical distancing[^232], while in the Philippines, the Defense
Secretary heads the national task force on COVID-19 and has sought full
military and police support to implement its pandemic plan.[^233]
Indonesia[^234] and the Philippines[^235] have also launched
contact-tracing apps that use the centralised model and have been
criticised for providing insufficient data protection.[^236] Trust
issues have thus impeded the widespread adoption of the government's
official contact-tracing app in both countries.

### Conclusion {#conclusion .BOOK_Heading-3}

Despite the four countries' varied approaches to COVID-19, they
nevertheless disproportionately and negatively impact marginalised
communities. It is clear that, although the virus does not discriminate,
its consequences do. Therefore, as governments around the world strive
to tackle the pandemic, it is imperative that they do so in a
transparent and rights-respecting manner, and in ways that are inclusive
of local communities.

## Fuera de Alcance: Educación a Distancia en Zonas Rurales Peruanas Durante la Pandemia (Karla Zavala Barreda) {#fuera-de-alcance-educación-a-distancia-en-zonas-rurales-peruanas-durante-la-pandemia-karla-zavala-barreda .BOOK_Heading-2}

***Out of Reach: Distance Learning in Peruvian Rural Areas During the
Pandemic***

*This blog post aims to analyze the actions carried out by the Peruvian
government regarding distance education and contrast them with the uses
and practices of technology in Andean rural communities. Likewise, it
problematizes digital inclusion and exclusion that is reflected through
the digital divide: who is included and who is excluded from the
Peruvian public school in the new normal setting.*

La cuarentena y las medidas de distanciamiento social han afectado el
desenvolvimiento de las actividades escolares a nivel nacional. En
marzo, luego de aplazar el inicio del año escolar por dos semanas, el
Ministerio de Educación desplegó el plan de enseñanza a distancia
'Aprendo en Casa'. La estrategia, a través de señal televisa y radial
abierta, busca reemplazar la educación presencial a través de sesiones
de aprendizajes adaptadas a dichos medios. La difusión del contenido
también se apoya de las radios comunitarias. No obstante, esta
estrategia no incluye a los centros poblados, donde hay un nivel muy
bajo de conectividad, y donde se encuentran comunidades que están fuera
del alcance de la señal de los medios masivos y de la cobertura de
internet.

En el Perú, la educación rural tiene un modelo de alternancia donde los
estudiantes asisten intermitentemente a clases. Luego del anuncio del
inicio de la cuarentena obligatoria, dichos estudiantes regresaron a sus
hogares, los cuales en muchos casos no cuentan con medios o conectividad
para acceder a los contenidos de Aprendo en Casa. Cabe preguntar
entonces, ¿cuál es el estado de los estudiantes en comunidades rurales
en el país que ha implementado una de las cuarentenas más estrictas a
nivel mundial?

### Educación a Distancia en Zonas Rurales {#educación-a-distancia-en-zonas-rurales .BOOK_Heading-3}

Frente a esta problemática de acceso al contenido escolar, se anunció la
adquisición de un millón de tabletas a ser repartidas a los estudiantes
y maestros de áreas rurales clasificadas en los quintiles 1 y 2 de
pobreza. En este contexto, cabe recordar que el gobierno peruano ha
implementado desde hace treinta años programas de compra equipos
informáticos en el sector educación, tales como Una Laptop por Niño,
proyecto Huascarán, Jornada Escolar Completa, entre otros. Sin embargo,
estas adquisiciones no ayudaron a amortiguar la necesidad de educación a
distancia que emergió durante esta crisis sanitaria, convirtiéndose así
en el gran elefante blanco del que poco se ha discutido.

Asimismo, la solución ofrecida para acortar la brecha de conectividad de
las zonas rurales es la inclusión de tabletas con chip y cargadores
solares. Pero sin señal satelital de internet en el área donde usarán la
tableta, el chip no podrá conectarse a ningún lado. Esta coyuntura es un
recordatorio de la materialidad de la infraestructura digital. Depende
de cables, de satélites, de proveedores y operadores para que la señal
llegue a quienes están fuera de alcance. La brecha digital entre zonas
urbanas y rurales es abismal. La conectividad en áreas rurales no
alcanza más del 20%, a esto se suma que el servicio ofrecido es de baja
calidad, y la velocidad de conexión es lenta.

Al implementar el aislamiento social obligatorio, las zonas rurales
fueron expuestas a un grado mayor de vulnerabilidad al no contar con
infraestructura y conectividad en sus hogares. Esta situación se agrava
en un país donde el gobierno apenas conoce a la realidad de la
población. Mientras el Ministerio de Educación señala que el 94% de los
estudiantes escolares está accediendo a los contenidos de Aprendo en
Casa, la Defensoría del Pueblo --institución nacional que defiende y
promueve los derechos de las personas y la comunidad-- indica que en
provincias el poco acceso a educación durante la pandemia ha
incrementado el número de deserción escolar.[^237] Por ejemplo, en Cerro
de Pasco, más de [7000
estudiantes](https://www.defensoria.gob.pe/defensoria-del-pueblo-mas-de-7000-estudiantes-no-acceden-a-clases-virtuales/)
no acceden a la educación a distancia.[^238] Situación similar ocurre en
una de las regiones más pobres del país, Huánuco, donde más del 30% de
escolares tampoco cuenta con acceso.

### Prácticas desde la Periferia {#prácticas-desde-la-periferia .BOOK_Heading-3}

A casi dos meses de la clausura del año escolar, las tabletas aún no
llegan a los destinatarios. Y aunque llegaran, la distribución de dichos
dispositivos no resolverá las dificultades de conectividad y acceso a
información. Es en este escenario donde acciones como las del alcalde de
Corani, localidad de Puno, al sur de país, llaman la atención, no solo
porque contrató la instalación antenas satelitales para brindar conexión
a cinco comunidades rurales en extrema pobreza, sino por el razonamiento
detrás de esta acción: proveer acceso libre a internet.[^239] Mientras
los sistemas digitales continúen absorbiendo y embebiendo actividades
sociales, la infraestructura de conexión efectivamente determina y
restringe cómo los usuarios se comunican y acceden a información. Es por
estas razones que el acceso a internet se ha declarado como un derecho
humano, ya que no solo ayuda a difundir contenidos educativos sino
también a acceder a servicios del estado sin necesidad de desplazamiento
geográfico, y conocer los derechos.

Al optar por la transmisión de sesiones de aprendizaje a través de
medios de comunicación e internet, el gobierno peruano no garantiza el
derecho de acceso a la educación a quienes no cuenten con los medios
necesarios para acceder a dicho contenido. Al condicionar dicho acceso,
se incrementa la vulnerabilidad de poblaciones rurales en extrema
pobreza. En contraste, lo sucedido en Corani no solo beneficia a los
estudiantes, sino también a los miembros de la comunidad, que pueden
acceder a información respecto a los bonos repartidos durante la
pandemia, y también a los estudiantes universitarios o de carreras
técnicas, que gracias a este servicio pueden conectarse a sus clases
virtuales.

A la vez, se hace frente a una problemática que pasa desapercibida: la
compra de paquetes de datos móviles. Durante la cuarentena, miembros de
comunidades rurales adquieren semanalmente paquetes de datos para que
sus hijos puedan acceder a la educación a distancia. Imágenes de niños
buscando señal en la cima de las montañas se han compartido en las redes
sociales sin cuestionar quién cubre el costo de esa conexión. En otras
palabras, la educación que antes era gratuita se constituye como un
costo adicional al estar mediada.

Por otro lado, nuevamente la materialidad de los contenidos digitales
necesita ser abordada. Internet no está compuesta de solo bits y señales
que fluyen de manera invisible en el aire. El contenido audiovisual
demanda el uso muchos datos móviles, y a su vez esta transmisión de
datos depende de infraestructura que provea conexión. Si contrastamos la
penetración de celulares se puede observar que más de un 85% de hogares
rurales cuenta con un dispositivo móvil (INEI, 2020). Sin embargo, solo
un 5.9% tiene acceso a internet. Poniendo este dato en el contexto
actual y los retos que el distanciamiento social presenta, cabe
cuestionar qué tanto se toman en consideración los celulares en la
difusión, diseño, y desarrollo de la educación a distancia. Por ejemplo,
si el ancho de banda no es óptimo, ¿hay versiones lite (bajo uso de
datos, poco uso de imágenes, etc.) de las páginas y apps educativas?
¿Por qué no se toma política de mobile-first como en otros países?

Estos interrogantes abren el diálogo para dejar de privilegiar la
adquisición de tecnología de punta y el uso de nuevos medios en
estrategias nacionales sin tomar en cuenta el ensamblaje socio-técnico
que permite la conexión a Internet. En el Perú hay muchas áreas que
siguen fuera de alcance, y no es coincidencia que sean los mismos
espacios geográficos donde se encuentran las comunidades rurales. Por
otro lado, decisiones como la compra de tabletas sin una propuesta
íntegra hace evidente la falta de planes sostenibles en el tiempo para
la implementación de iniciativas tecnológicas, que si bien buscan cerrar
las brechas digitales, no parecen tomar en cuenta la realidad de las
diferentes regiones del país.

## COVID-19 in the UK: The Exacerbation of Inequality and a Digitally-Based Response (**Massimo Ragnedda & Maria Laura Ruiu)** {#covid-19-in-the-uk-the-exacerbation-of-inequality-and-a-digitally-based-response-massimo-ragnedda-maria-laura-ruiu .BOOK_Heading-2}

The consequences of the COVID-19 outbreak---in social, economic,
psychological and health terms---are still unclear, since the effects of
the containment measures could last for years. However, something seems
to be quite clear: vulnerable people and vulnerable communities are
those who suffer the most from this outbreak. This is not surprising,
since both social and medical studies have repeatedly shown an
interaction between social environment and health status.

In this essay, we specifically focus on the UK (even though similar
arguments could be applied to other countries in the Global North) where
some social groups are suffering more than others from the outbreak.
Black, Asian or minority ethnic background (BAME communities) and
elderly and marginalized citizens are affected the most by the pandemic.
The COVID-19 crisis has, indeed, triggered inequality by exposing more
vulnerable groups to higher risks of experiencing the most severe
symptoms of the disease.

### **BAME Communities are the Most Affected in the UK** {#bame-communities-are-the-most-affected-in-the-uk .BOOK_Heading-3}

Despite the fact that there is no link between genetic predispositions
to the virus and racial groups, BAME communities are the most affected
in the UK.[^240] There are, indeed, several social factors that
influence a higher frequency of death from coronavirus among vulnerable
communities in the UK. First of all, BAME communities make up a large
share of professions considered indispensable in tackling the virus.
Many of these jobs are public-facing, so they are potentially more
exposed to the virus. Secondly, on average, BAME groups in Western
societies, due to longstanding social inequalities, suffer from
generally worse health conditions. The link between socioeconomic
factors and health status is well known. An emphasis on social aspects
rather than a biological or genetic predisposition, underlines that the
ways in which societies are organised tend to penalise already
disadvantaged communities and citizens, therefore further reinforcing
social inequalities.

### **Digital Inequalities Exacerbate Social and Health Inequalities** {#digital-inequalities-exacerbate-social-and-health-inequalities .BOOK_Heading-3}

There is also a third element, often under-evaluated, which highlights
how socially discriminated people suffer the most from the COVID-19
pandemic: digital inequalities. COVID-19 outbreak has shown, among many
other things, how digital skills, high-speed internet, and reliable
hardware and software are essential conditions not only for social
wellbeing, but also for everyday life. The digital divide, in fact, does
not only include uneven access to resources and knowledge, but also
limited human connections and unequal access to opportunities and health
services. Being digitally excluded also affects the ability to manage
the coronavirus-related drawbacks. In a time where one-third of the
world population is locked down, a exclusion from the digital arena also
means a potential exclusion from essential online services, such as
health services, e-learning, accurate and trustworthy information
related to COVID-19 and purchase of essentials online. In a collective
academic effort, we developed the COVID-19 exposure risk profiles
(CERPs),[^241] which show that "All else equal, individuals who can more
effectively digitize key parts of their lives enjoy better CERPs than
individuals who cannot digitize these life realms".

The digital divide is a real and thoughtful threat that requires
tangible and future-proof solutions. This suggests that tackling
inequalities not only means providing access to ICTs, but also skills
and literacy to ensure an adequate digital experience. In the UK, for
instance, 11.7 million people lack essential digital skills.[^242] This
number suggests that 22% of the UK population have difficulty in
accessing online information and updates about COVID-19.[^243] Both
elderly people (especially from ethnic minorities)[^244] and people with
disabilities tend to have limited capacity to access ICTs and an
elementary digital competence.[^245] This suggests that self-isolation
might be particularly challenging because the lack of access and skills
contribute towards increasing loneliness by limiting people's contact
with relatives or friends.[^246]

### **Tackling Digital Inequalities to Reduce COVID-19's Effects** {#tackling-digital-inequalities-to-reduce-covid-19s-effects .BOOK_Heading-3}

Access to the internet is a new civil right and a public utility. In
this sense, bridging the digital divide means treating internet access
as an essential service. For this reason, during the COVID-19 pandemic,
several public and private initiatives around the world were promoted to
tackle the digital divide and support digitally excluded people. In the
UK, for instance, some organisations such as "Future dot now UK"
launched an initiative named \#DevicesDotNow that provides digital
devices to help the most vulnerable to access to the digital realm. The
purpose of this initiative is to enable the digitally excluded to access
online services, support and information needed during the pandemic.
However, access alone is not enough to ensure the success of the digital
experience. In a time where more than 11 million people in the UK lack
digital skills, the possession of devices alone does not guarantee
digital inclusion. For this reason, the Goodthing Foundation created a
suite of resources to support the most vulnerable in using the internet
during the COVID-19 pandemic. These initiatives included a suite of
resources to help people find trustworthy health advice from reliable
sources or more practical advice such as how to use apps to call their
doctors. Furthermore, the literature shows that giving the possibilities
to keep in touch with family and friends to the most vulnerable people
(especially when they are required to stay at home) helps reduce the
negative effects of social isolation and loneliness (NHS 2019).

Evidently, digital inequalities cannot be bridged overnight, but these
initiatives are particularly useful in time of crisis. More
specifically, these initiatives are useful in tackling digital
inequalities, because they look at the digital divide not only in terms
of inequalities in access (first level of digital divide) but also in
terms of uneven digital skills (second level) and uneven tangible
outcomes people get from accessing and using the internet (third level).
In fact, by providing devices to access ICTs, these initiatives are
reducing the first level, while providing basic digital skills to tackle
the second level of digital divide. Overall these initiatives reduce
also the third level of digital divide, by providing tangible and
externally measurable outcomes (calling doctors, shopping and banking
online) that improve people's life chances.[^247] Therefore, the
COVID-19 shows the importance of bridging digital inequalities to
facilitate social relationships, global functions/interconnections and
ordinary activities.

### **Lessons Learned** {#lessons-learned .BOOK_Heading-3}

Social and digital inequalities highlighted how specific subgroups are
significantly more vulnerable to exposure to COVID-19, compared to their
privileged counterparts. The crisis shows that social and digital
solutions can be quickly implemented when necessary, but they need
continuity to be effective. The lesson learned concerns the ability of
policymakers to provide long-term strategies (as well as emergency
plans) to tackle social and digital challenges. In fact, during a moment
of crisis, the effects produced by social inclusion and
digital-enhancing initiatives can only be limited because of the
impossibility of tackling all the different levels of social and digital
inequalities at the same time. In time of crisis, only a select group of
people will be able to access the benefits provided by the emergency
solutions in action. It is therefore necessary to consider social and
digital inequalities as part of the same problem and promote initiatives
to foster social and digital equity.

In conclusion, we may reiterate what we have tried to say throughout
this essay: the COVID-19 virus does not discriminate, but exacerbates
existing social discrimination. It cannot be addressed as the sole cause
of inequalities, but it brings to light the vulnerability of our unequal
social assets. The COVID-19 might teach us that, despite our social
adaptation capacity, being socially and digitally equipped can help
mitigate the effects of global crises.

## Africa\'s Responses to COVID-19: An Early Data Science View (Vukosi Marivate, Elaine Nsoesie & Herkulaas MVE Combrink) {#africas-responses-to-covid-19-an-early-data-science-view-vukosi-marivate-elaine-nsoesie-herkulaas-mve-combrink .BOOK_Heading-2}

COVID-19 is a unique event that has shaken the world. It has disrupted
the way we live, how we work, and what we think. Across Africa, the
arrival of COVID-19 also drew attention to the continent. We have had to
live through grim forecasts of how "badly" the continent was going to
respond to the virus, or whether the continent was different and we
would not feel the impact. Given that we are still in the midst of the
pandemic, we have a hard task of sifting through the opinions and
reports to get to a better understanding of what has happened. We have
to deal both with trying to better measure impact[^248] or contemplate
if natural remedies would prevent spread.[^249] As data scientists, we
believe that what is measured obscures shortcomings that otherwise might
enlighten us on how we can better deal with such situations in the
future.

Africa has significant experience dealing with infectious disease
epidemics. For example, countries in West and Central Africa have
responded over the decades to Ebola outbreaks[^250], and Southern Africa
has had
[HIV/AIDS](https://www.avert.org/professionals/hiv-around-world/sub-saharan-africa/south-africa)
to deal with.[^251] The experiences gained from these epidemics have
prepared African health systems to respond to the pandemic. We are
likely to see many research papers in the coming years dissecting what
impact this preparedness may have had. In this article, we focus on how
Africa worked to track COVID and what that might mean for data
scientists in the future. What should we learn? Where did things go
well? Where did things fail? How do we improve?

### When we Measure the Spread {#when-we-measure-the-spread .BOOK_Heading-3}

As the pandemic spread across the Northern Hemisphere, throughout the
African continent questions formed about the potential impact of
COVID-19 on different African countries. In many countries, COVID
working groups were set up. These working groups were typically were
made up of government and external experts who planned to look at
different factors in the responses to COVID-19. In many instances, these
groups used data to track COVID-19 and assist in modelling and
data-driven decision making. One would have noticed the proliferation of
country-led dashboards or infographics on the COVID-19 spread.[^252] In
some countries, numbers were difficult to track and understand, because
of low numbers of tests. The tracking of COVID-19 spread required a
pipeline that could test, report, and aggregate information in a
meaningful way for epidemiological and clinical surveillance.

### Challenges in Reporting {#challenges-in-reporting .BOOK_Heading-3}

We have seen international challenges to the free, transparent, and open
reporting on the severity of COVID-19. Some African countries had these
challenges as well, from denying the pandemic exists[^253] to refusing
to release information on testing and confirmed cases.[^254] These
challenges cannot be explained by simplistic reasons such as political
pandering, but likely indicate challenges in resources available to
respond to the pandemic. Countries have been stretched thin in a short
period of time, and systems may not have the capacity to change
direction this quickly. In this environment, how do you compile
statistics and share meaningful information with both the public and
policy stakeholders?

### COVID-19 Will Still be With us {#covid-19-will-still-be-with-us .BOOK_Heading-3}

No one should underplay how COVID-19 will ultimately impact African
countries. Its impact will not only be on healthcare; many sectors of
society will likely be reeling from the sustained effects of the
pandemic. There is already looming evidence about the adverse and
secondary damage to other sectors such as education, crime, healthcare,
and the economy.[^255] Decisions on border and business closures made
during the early stages of the outbreak may also have lasting effects on
countries in Africa.

### Tracking More than Health {#tracking-more-than-health .BOOK_Heading-3}

COVID-19 has affected more than just health, and the effects will be
with us for some time. As we move into second waves in some countries,
we are now deciding how to rehabilitate economies, the education
systems, and tourism. All of these decisions require data that crosses
between national statistics offices and stakeholders. To better plan
recoveries and interventions, organisations and states are working to
use data to make choices about which interventions might be best. This
process extends the need for data beyond the healthcare system toward a
coordinated response driven by the public, private and non-governmental
institutions. Data and data related issues are the ultimate reflection
of people and capacity issues present within a system. If we are to
combat negative outcomes, we should all work toward capacitating our
nations to prepare for the future.

### Lessons we Must Learn {#lessons-we-must-learn .BOOK_Heading-3}

Counting is hard. It requires will, cooperation and resources that
together improve policy. We need to learn how to set up the data
infrastructure so that counting can catalyze data practices in the
future. Yet, setting up a data infrastructure requires money and human
capacity. Across the global population, we will have more emergencies to
deal with. As such, governments must prepare adequately during the
"peace times." If we do not prepare, we will not get ahead to manage
future crisis and crisis situations better. Investing in capacity and
building the required skills to disseminate information in a more
reliable way helps prepare us for the future. We should never sway away
from training, innovation and incentivising education for the purpose of
growth and improvement. Technical skills across all sectors---especially
within healthcare---have served vital roles during the pandemic and will
continues to do so. Capacitating the healthcare system with the
technical skills to manage information, actively strive for excellence,
and innovate still remains the foundation of preparedness, and drives
the proactive strategies we need to be successful as a society.

## Silent Silencing: A Survivor's Reflection on Domestic Violence During COVID-19 (Anonymous) {#silent-silencing-a-survivors-reflection-on-domestic-violence-during-covid-19-anonymous .BOOK_Heading-2}

On September 17, 2020, the policy blog Ideas for India published a study
on rates of domestic violence during India's lockdown, which started on
March 23.[^256] It showed that domestic violence complaints had
increased by 131% in May 2020 in districts with the strictest lockdown
rules ("red zone"). It also reported data from a survey that asked men
and women whether "a husband is justified in hitting or beating his wife
in a number of circumstances, including neglect of the house or
children, improper cooking, disrespect for in-laws, and refusal to have
sex." Results show that "red zone" districts where a greater proportion
of husbands reported that hitting or beating his wife is justified
experienced greater increases in domestic violence complaints in April
and May 2020 relative to "green zone" districts. Such results align with
[scholarship](https://www.ideasforindia.in/topics/social-identity/covid-19-lockdown-and-domestic-abuse.html)
on the effects of lockdown on domestic violence and their measurability,
calling for inclusive data visualisation.[^257]

As activists on domestic violence are aware, we leverage data to pass
clear, effective messages to our audiences. Domestic violence
statistics, as well as femicide data, offer a powerful synopsis of the
horror of living with abuse, and of the tragic culmination of situations
where abuse is not addressed. Narrating abuse is hard not only for the
narrator but also for the listener. By way of example, in multiple
occasions the author of this chapter had persons asking her to "stop" or
to "refrain from talking about abuse." And still, for those survivors
and others involved in helping people recognise the signs of abuse,
statistics provide a numeric anchor to start sensitisation, to prevent
people from turning a blind eye. So in that respect, statistics serve as
a tool for sensitisation and awareness-raising.

But for us survivors, the limits of statistics still remain.

### **The Twisted Meaning of Domestic Violence Statistics** {#the-twisted-meaning-of-domestic-violence-statistics .BOOK_Heading-3}

Statistics are merely about reported abuse. We know, in some
national/institutional environments more than others, that reporting of
certain forms of domestic violence is discouraged depending on context.
In societies across the world, abuse is stigmatised, silenced, and
blamed on the victim. As someone notified in a seminar recently, "you
will never put your name and face on such a claim." The author of this
chapter, a survivor from a southern European country, has been actively
advised not to report her abuser, for fears of retaliation and
triggering memories. We report, if we really want to. But we are also
ignored, laughed at, scorned, and discouraged when we do so. As a
result, many of us do not report domestic abuse.

Can you see now why we are so confident in arguing that domestic
violence statistics, as powerful as they are, are likely to seriously
underrepresent the phenomenon?

### **Silent Silencing** {#silent-silencing .BOOK_Heading-3}

But nobody will openly admit to silencing a domestic violence survivor.
Nobody will ever openly tell you "it is not acceptable to talk about
survival." Silencing, as we experience it in our everyday existence, is
in itself... silent. Nobody says "do not talk about it." They will say,
"not here. This is not the place, not the right occasion." Do not talk
about it to colleagues, it will undermine your position of power. Do not
talk about it in social occasions, it is inappropriate. Do not talk
about it to the extended family, you will make them worried without a
reason. In a nutshell, overall, survive if you can, but do not tell us
about it.

We survive, those of us who do. But the product of survival---us---is
not socially accepted. As I mentioned above, one month after reporting
my abuser, a close family member told me to "lower my voice" while
talking about it in a social occasion. We are allowed to survive, if we
manage to. But then, we are forbidden to talk.

I spend substantial time collecting the most accurate statistics and
reports to talk about survival. Statistics go beyond grabbing the
listener's attention, and offer a photograph of the issue that
numerically is the most accurate we have. But when it is our life, we
are silently silenced. We are encouraged to stay put, and lower our
voice. Because it is fine to survive. But it is not professionally or
socially acceptable to live as a survivor.

Read statistics and use them in your work. Build on them to bring the
ongoing, pandemic-induced rise in domestic violence to the world's
attention, to break the silence that still dominates most parts of the
world. But when you read statistics, just recognize that many of us live
in silence with the responsibility of being the voice of those whose
abusers have silenced forever. We cannot put our names and faces to
these voices, for the safety of our own loved ones and our very selves.
And we cannot talk, because it is not "socially acceptable." So please
do use statistics. But when you do, remember that our silenced voices
lie behind them.

## Beyond Touchscreens: The Perils of Biometric Social Welfare in Lockdown (Silvia Masiero) {#beyond-touchscreens-the-perils-of-biometric-social-welfare-in-lockdown-silvia-masiero .BOOK_Heading-2}

Over the last several years, India has gradually introduced biometric
identification of users in most of its social welfare schemes. One of
its main schemes is the Public Distribution System (PDS), the nation's
largest food security programme, which provides rationed subsidized
commodities to the nation's poor through a network of shops. Biometric
access to the PDS is largely operated through Aadhaar, the world's
largest digital identification scheme, which provides enrolees with a
12-digit number and captures biometric credentials (ten fingerprint
scans and iris scans) for recognition. While modalities of identity
identification and authentication differ through the country, states
that adopted an Aadhaar-enabled PDS required recipients to authenticate
through a biometric point-of-sale machine to receive rations.

As a consequence of the COVID-19 crisis, biometric authentication in
ration shops has been suspended in several Indian states. A commonly
given reason for the suspension is the risk of disease
transmission[^258] associated to users' fingerprint contact with the
machine, which falls under the broader remit of social distancing
measures taken within the ongoing pandemic. The Indian case epitomises,
however, a global trend of anti-poverty programmes transitioning to
biometric identification in programmes that---in the light of very
serious effects of the COVID-19 crisis on vulnerable groups---are now
more crucial to their recipients than ever. In the context of COVID-19,
what perils are involved in the perpetuated subordination of social
welfare access to biometric identification?

### The Trade-Offs of Digital Identity {#the-trade-offs-of-digital-identity .BOOK_Heading-3}

With reference to the use of biometrics in India's social welfare
system, many researchers have highlighted the distance the anti-leakage
rationale and exclusionary effects yielded by such technologies. Most
recently, it has been reported on a large-scale experiment conducted in
Jharkhand[^259], a state where deaths by starvation due to failed
Aadhaar-enabled authentication of PDS beneficiaries were previously
reported.[^260] The results of the study revealed a 10% reduction in
benefits for recipients (23% of the total) who had not linked Aadhaar
credentials to benefit rolls, with 3% receiving no benefits at all. Such
exclusionary effects mirror previous studies of the Aadhaar-based PDS in
the same state. Other studies reported on the anxiety brought in poor
people's lives by the uncertainties of biometrically-enabled foodgrain
distribution.[^261]

The policy vision behind biometric anti-poverty schemes can be
summarized in terms of two different types of error being tackled. In
targeted welfare schemes, an *exclusion error* means the exclusion of
genuinely entitled subjects, while an *inclusion error* refers to the
erroneous inclusion of non-entitled subjects into provision. By matching
biometric records (collected through databases such as Aadhaar) with
records of recipients' entitlements, biometric anti-poverty schemes
promise to maximize the affordance of proper targeting, offering
credentials to the excluded and preventing access to the erroneously
included. This rationale is used as the basis of their ever-increasing
incorporation in anti-poverty programmes, of which the Aadhaar-enabled
Indian system is a notable example.

But the reality revealed by extant research, including our previous work
on the Karnataka PDS, differs from the orthodoxy of good
targeting.[^262] First, as illustrated most recently by other
authors,requiring biometric identification at the ration shop does not
prevent diversion, because the system affords the recording of
successful disbursement even if rations are not provided as per
eligibility.[^263] Second, there is a trade-off between anti-leakage
affordances, in the form of accurate recognition at the point of sale,
and the repeated exclusions of entitled beneficiaries. Reasons given
range from machines malfunctioning to the unreliability of fingerprint
readability among the elderly and manual labourers. In the
Aadhaar-enabled PDS, the need for multiple fragile technologies to work
at the same time, as highlighted by Jean Drèze, poses a systemic problem
of practical feasibility, which impacts those parts of the country most
subjected to infrastructural issues.[^264] While inclusion errors are
(at least in principle) targeted by the rationale of biometrics,
exclusions keep happening, and raise questions about how a social
welfare system should cover the most vulnerable groups.

### COVID-19: A Reshuffling of Priorities {#covid-19-a-reshuffling-of-priorities .BOOK_Heading-3}

In the midst of the ongoing crisis, many studies are being conducted on
the effects of COVID-19 on health infrastructures and economic
vulnerabilities in the Global South. Studies of factory workers,
gig-workers, and low-income households all point in the same direction:
the economic impact brought by national lockdowns is disproportionally
affecting the poor and vulnerable, large proportions of whom are
recipients of social welfare systems.[^265] Where such systems have
limited reach or are not available, measures of immediate assistance are
invoked, such as the provision of universal basic income or emergency
social safety nets.[^266] In the Indian PDS, the promise of doubling
foodgrain rations along with providing extra commodities increases the
scheme's importance.[^267] This is particularly important during a
pandemic, when new vulnerabilities, such as migrant workers being
exposed to distress and food insecurity, have emerged in the wake of
lockdown.[^268]

In these times of heightened crisis, severely affecting the users of
anti-poverty schemes, the exclusion errors induced by mandatory
biometric access are a risk that social protection schemes cannot afford
to take. While the incorporation of biometrics is purposefully designed
to improve targeting, the crisis challenges us to adapt systems in such
a way that biometric recognition is, at the very least, suspended. While
the problem of touchscreen-induced disease transmission is in itself a
valid reason for suspending the program, the inclusion-exclusion
trade-off illustrated here poses an equal problem that needs
consideration. As systems are adapted to coping with the COVID-19
crisis, the need for assisting the affected should prevail over the
stringent adoption of biometric credentials.

## On Not Being Visible to the State: The Case of Peru (Diego Cerna Aragón) {#on-not-being-visible-to-the-state-the-case-of-peru-diego-cerna-aragón .BOOK_Heading-2}

The World Health Organization recently declared that South America is
the new epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic[^269]. Peru has the second
largest overall number of registered infections in the region, only
behind Brazil, which has almost seven times the population of
Peru.[^270] Initially, the Peruvian government was lauded for its swift
response and for implementing strict measures to halt the transmission
of the virus.[^271] More recently, however, the country has been
featured on the international press as a place where the expansion of
the disease simply cannot be contained, despite the early harsh
restrictions. Stories of inner massive displacements and testimonies of
the employment of Venezuelan immigrants to pick up dead bodies give an
idea of how Peru is currently dealing with the pandemic.[^272]

### Targeting in the Midst of a Pandemic {#targeting-in-the-midst-of-a-pandemic .BOOK_Heading-3}

On March 19, 2020, three days after decreeing a national state of
emergency and quarantine, the Peruvian government announced that it was
going to distribute a 380-sole subsidy (approximately 110 USD) to
vulnerable households.[^273] The idea behind this plan was to offer
economic relief to people who had to stop working given the emergency
measures. In a country where over 70% of the labor force is in the
informal sector---meaning these workers are not included in any state or
company payrolls, and rely on self-employment and casual
gigs---enforcing a quarantine meant that the majority of the working
population had to give up their daily income and way of life.[^274]

The database from which the vulnerable household information was
retrieved is in the hands of the Household Targeting System (SISFOH).
Because it was originally used to target poor and extremely poor
households for the provision of social welfare benefits, this database
was state officials deemed it capable of providing accurate information
about which households would need financial assistance during the
quarantine. Quickly, the public debate gravitated towards economic
definitions: what is the meaning of being vulnerable? Who should be
included in the registry to receive government assistance? As part of a
well-disciplined neoliberal state, Peruvian national government agencies
always strive to streamline social spending. Yet, as days went by, it
became clear that the more than two million households initially
targeted were not the only ones requiring assistance. Consequently, the
government announced a new subsidy on March 26th, this time targeting
"independent workers". [^275]

The SISFOH database has one defining characteristic: it usually works
under an on-demand logic. Unless a household requests to be evaluated to
receive social welfare benefits, the system assigns them a default
socioeconomic classification based on cross-referencing information from
other databases, such as census, property registry, and electricity
consumption. Under normal circumstances, households in urban areas that
do not request an evaluation are not included in recipients of social
welfare benefits. In cases where a household requests to be evaluated,
on the other hand, incertitude is the rule.[^276] Neither the applicants
nor the local bureaucrats who work for the system know exactly how it
operates; the classification algorithm is opaque to them. According to
technocrats from the national government, this feature is intended to
curb possible attempts to game the system. In the exceptional context of
the pandemic, however, the government decided to test the accuracy of
the database to target households in need. Unfortunately, it failed to
provide a sufficiently broad safety net. Later on, the government
realized its mistake and the Minister of Development and Social
Inclusion (MIDIS) announced that eventually it would have to change
methods and start actively evaluating households.[^277]

The government's failure to provide a lifeline to people in need did not
go without consequences. By mid-April, a month after the quarantine
began, people started leaving Lima, Peru's capital and most populated
city, because they had not received any state assistance in the last
month.[^278] They had depleted their savings, could no longer pay their
rents, and were evicted by their landlords. Without anywhere to sleep or
money to buy food, many Peruvians started walking back to their
hometowns in the countryside, given that all long-distance
transportation was banned due to the emergency measures.

Additionally, another critical issue surfaced related to subsidy
distribution. Given that less than 40% of the adult population is in the
Peru's banking system, a large portion of people could not receive the
subsidy in a bank account.[^279] Instead, people had to go to bank
offices to receive the subsidy in cash. Furthermore, many were confused
about the multiple subsidy announcements made by the government.[^280]
Driven by confusion, people went to the banks simply to inquire if they
were going to receive subsidies. As later recognized by the government,
the concentration of people in banks proved to be a major transmission
vehicle for the novel coronavirus.[^281]

After repeated demands in social media[^282], the government announced a
new "universal" subsidy on April 23, 2020.[^283] Despite the name, the
subsidy was not really universal. As President Martin Vizcarra
explained, the distribution of this subsidy would be determined through
"reverse targeting."[^284] Still relying on the SISFOH database, this
subsidy was projected to reach every household that did not have a
member on state or company payrolls---a total of 6.8 million households.
Instead of acknowledging the limitations of targeting and opting for an
actual universal subsidy, the government insisted on streamlining its
social spending. On May 25---32 days after the announcement of the
universal subsidy and 71 days after the quarantine started---the
government indicated that 3.4 million households had received a subsidy,
only half of their 6.8 million goal.[^285]

The main problem with the Peruvian government is not the availability of
funding. Every time authorities announce a new subsidy, they commit to
increasing their spending. The main problem, this article argues, is its
leaders' determination to address the consequences of a public health
crisis using technologies devised for poverty-alleviating programs.
Targeting technologies are designed to restrain spending and filter
people. Moreover, in the case of the weak Peruvian state, they rely on
irregular practices of information collection. Even before the pandemic,
applicants to social welfare benefits and local bureaucrats complained
about the stringent reasoning of the system and how its tools (e.g.,
forms) failed to grasp the material precarious experience by the
citizens.[^286] The technocratic asset of a rigorous algorithm brought
woe to those in need. These technologies, by design and implementation,
render people invisible.

### Being Visible in the Global South {#being-visible-in-the-global-south .BOOK_Heading-3}

Creative minds in the Western cultural industry have been prolific
producers of dystopian fictions where state-like actors know every
little detail about every member of the population. The case of Peru is
quite the opposite; it is a state which barely knows its population.
What we have witnessed---"invisible" people who do not receive any
assistance from the state, walking for days to return to their hometowns
without having something to eat, without knowing if they are carriers of
a deadly virus---seems like a worst-case scenario.[^287]

Liberal anxieties in the Global North---sometimes rapidly adopted by
educated elites in developing countries---have focused academic
attention on issues of privacy. What terrifies them is being identified
by state actors, probably because they do not want to be treated as
their governments regularly treat minorities in their countries. We
already hear warnings on how everyone should be afraid of a "Chinese
model" of surveillance[^288], as if China was the only country to
surveil its citizens[^289]. We will probably never see a protest sign
reading "We want to be visible to the state!" And yet, millions of
people worldwide belong to the informal sector, a limbo-like domain
where individuals participate in daily social and economic activities
while not being completely integrated. This may function precariously,
as long as the economy keeps running. But as soon as it stops, like
during COVID-19 quarantine, the downfall is catastrophic. Without being
part of a state registry, the help cannot arrive in an adequate and
timely fashion. In an era when many of the deaths remain unofficial,
while people cannot eat because they are not counted, being visible to
the state is a privilege.

## The Case of the Solidarity Income in Colombia: The Experimentation With Data on Social Policy During the Pandemic (Joan Lopéz) {#the-case-of-the-solidarity-income-in-colombia-the-experimentation-with-data-on-social-policy-during-the-pandemic-joan-lopéz .BOOK_Heading-2}

Colombian social policy since the 1990s can be understood as liberal,
because it was based on targeting resources on people below the poverty
line. The Colombian state has created mechanisms to identify the poor
people and bring the limited resources available to them. How is this
approach evolving during the pandemic, and what is the role of "big
data" in this process?

### Different Programs {#different-programs .BOOK_Heading-3}

The System of Possible Beneficiaries of Social Programs (known as
*Sisbén* in Spanish) has appeared as the main instrument to target
social assistance. This system rates people with scores from 0 to 100 in
terms of household prosperity. To grasp the difference between
Solidarity Income and more traditional social policies, we should
understand how data was used to identify the beneficiaries of social
benefits. *Sisbén'*s targeted social programs examined the conditions of
each household, conscripting citizens as actors in data production. The
score emerged from an institutional effort to virtually search for
vulnerable populations through surveys of impoverished areas. Depending
on the score received, families were made eligible for social programs
implemented by different state agencies.

The Solidarity Income system, set up in response to the pandemic, has
changed the relationship between the data used to assign a benefit and
the participation of people in the system. This experiment involved
using as much data as possible to find people who needed the subsidy but
were not yet receiving other social programs. The program built a new
Master Information Database, in which the National Development Office
(NDO) ["]{dir="rtl"}mixed" different administrative records using data
collected for diverse purposes and managed by private and public
actors.[^290] These databases have varying quality levels, and the
existence of some was unknown even for many Colombians.

The experiment ended up opening the "Pandora's box" of the Colombian
government information systems and showing its dependence on the private
sector. The Colombian approach has appeared broken from the start; when
the NDO published a list of beneficiaries, many citizens reported
inclusion errors regarding non-existent and expired ID cards. In
response, I argue that the challenge is no longer how to find vulnerable
people in the areas affected by poverty, but how to take advantage of
the personal data that Colombian citizens provide in their interaction
with different institutions.

### The Unilateral Decisions {#the-unilateral-decisions .BOOK_Heading-3}

The NDO's response was to dismantle the database and deliver it to the
National Civil Registry in charge of the national ID system for
deduplication. This process reportedly[^291] resulted in nearly 17,000
records with inconsistencies. After the incident, the NDO assured the
public that the errors did not matter because the banks verified the
identity of the recipient before making a transaction. Also, in the case
of communities with no access to financial services, the public agency
used databases of the prisons and the Forensic Medicine Institute[^292]
to remove IDs that were marked in those databases as duplicate or
deceased. This situation revealed that the state registries have serious
quality problems and exposed an approach to public policy that
indiscriminately exploited databases.

In addition, these targeting practices imply a form of violence for
individuals and families who are left out. We will never know how many
people were unfairly excluded in the crosschecks of databases of uneven
quality. However, we can analyze the narrative behind the Solidarity
Income initiative. The bureaucracy is using these data-intensive
solutions to avoid a political discussion that involves deciding who
should be eligible for social redistribution in a time of crisis, what
are the life consequences for the excluded, and what alternatives they
might have. For example, the selection of beneficiaries in the South of
the country---based on high levels of poverty, unemployment,
informality, and inequality---are the results of arbitrary data-based
mechanisms. Why did the NDO draw a line between potential beneficiaries
in a pandemic on 8.7 million families when there were 17 million at risk
of falling into poverty?[^293] This question requires a political
discussion that depends on transparency and participation.

## 

### Silencing Dissenting Voices Through Data {#silencing-dissenting-voices-through-data .BOOK_Heading-3}

The design of the Solidarity Income system makes it impossible for
citizens to reclaim their rights. People are unable to request that
information be corrected, obtain information on decision procedures, and
make a claim to challenge the results. What[']{dir="rtl"}s more, the
system does not allow potential beneficiaries to actively participate in
the construction of the social policy that gives them agency in an
emergency crisis. This is why I contend that the recent initiatives of
Colombian state take away people[']{dir="rtl"}s agency to demand their
social rights and actively participate in a political discussion that
shapes them. Moreover, Solidarity Income is based on an incorrect
assumption. Data does not faithfully correspond to reality, but
represents the politics of government. Most importantly, it represents
the social inequalities that shape it. Communities in poverty could be
easily invisibilized or misrepresented by that system.

Technocrats are hiding behind data and technological solutions to deny
people the agency to participate in the state's decisions, claim
injustice, and claim the protection of their social rights. They
reportedly dismiss citizens' complaints as "myths" and deny the agency
of the citizens.[^294] The official line has been that "there are no
mistakes."[^295] In other words, Colombians are facing a government that
unilaterally claims to know the people in need and denies their
participation in the process. The government even claims that dissenting
voices are abusive; "they are being manipulated" or "they want to skip
the line."[^296] Technocrats use technologies and data to avoid having
political discussions.

In sum, Solidarity Income is an example of the gloomy future of social
policy in which people have fewer mechanisms to reclaim their rights
vis-a-vis the State. It is also evidence that the real beneficiaries
will emerge from the data traces that Colombian citizens are
inadvertently leaving, and not from a conscious exercise in active
citizenship. The Colombian government might be selling the program as an
innovation, but it is nothing more than a large-scale experiment in
rolling out a data-intensive social policy scheme that allows the state
to "automatically" determine who deserves welfare support.
Unfortunately, this is a policy designed to eliminate (so-called)
inclusion errors, rather than for including citizens with agency. And
this dark system will use as much data as possible to find the fewest
possible beneficiaries.

## A Pandemia e a Nova Ordem Sociodigital no Sul Global: O Caso de São Paulo (Larissa G. de Magalhães) {#a-pandemia-e-a-nova-ordem-sociodigital-no-sul-global-o-caso-de-são-paulo-larissa-g.-de-magalhães .BOOK_Heading-2}

**The Pandemic and the New Sociodigital Order in the Global South: The
Case of São Paulo**

*What happens when the digital city encounters large-scale disasters
like the COVID-19 pandemic? This case study of São Paulo, Brazil
illustrates how the pandemic has exacerbated numerous inequalities. In
the largest metropolis in Latin America, the population lives in uneven
socioeconomic and cultural conditions. Marginalized groups in the city
shoulder the greatest risks of the pandemic, while struggling to access
and use the internet. As a result of these precarious conditions, an
"inequality virus" has emerged out of the pandemic.*

Nas últimas duas décadas, a proliferação de tecnologias digitais apoiou
um processo ambicioso de digitalização de ecossistemas urbanos
complexos, incluindo as de megacidades como São Paulo, Brasil. Mas o que
acontece quando essa tendência se choca com desastres e emergênccias em
massa como o COVID-19? Esses momentos de intensa crise representam um
ponto de virada na governança dos habitats urbanos, expondo a urgência
da capacidade de resposta baseada em dados, apoiada pelos avanços da
tecnologia.

Durante situações de crise, ferramentas analíticas e técnicas de
aprendizado de dados podem apoiar os tomadores de decisão com grandes
quantidades de dados, por exemplo, acionando alertas e ajudando os
governos a identificar as principais linhas de frente. No entanto, no
mundo em desenvolvimento, grandes setores da população permanecem
excluídos da esfera digital, e mesmo projetos de dados abertos liderados
pelo governo podem levar à sub-representação de certos grupos.[^297] À
medida que muitos desses países se tornam cada vez mais ativos on-line,
é provável que as desigualdades, incluindo o fosso digital, comprometam
as tentativas de usar dados para melhorar a qualidade de vida dos
cidadãos. Os padrões de desigualdade das megacidades, em particular,
revelam que as desigualdades sociais, econômicas, culturais e digitais
ainda são um desafio grave na definição das melhores estratégias para
combater crises que afetam toda a população.

Este artigo analisa o caso de São Paulo, Brasil---a cidade mais populosa
das Américas, com seus 12 milhões de habitantes---para explorar como as
oportunidades de acesso e o uso da internet no centro do projeto da
cidade digital seguem o padrão desigualdades estruturais, contribuindo,
em última análise, para reforçá-las. Essas desigualdades afetam mais
severamente os lares e famílias nas áreas mais periféricas e mais pobres
da cidade.

### Segregação Digital e a Cidade {#segregação-digital-e-a-cidade .BOOK_Heading-3}

Durante períodos de emergências, os tomadores de decisão podem ser
inundados com dados. De acordo com a OCDE (2019), no entanto, as lacunas
de dados causadas pelas desigualdades existentes podem criar problemas
para aqueles afetados por políticas criadas por bancos de dados
incompletos ou sub-representativos. Outro problema é o uso de sistemas
automatizados para coletar dados, especialmente de grupos que podem ter
um rótulo menos confiável do que as maiorias, devido à presença
["]{dir="rtl"}incorporada" na rede.[^298]

Como a tomada de decisões com base na falta de dados pode negligenciar
as linhas de pobreza traçadas na paisagem urbana, isso pode desencadear
custos de sobrevivência mais altos em áreas já marcadas pela segregação
social. É durante emergências de larga escala como o COVID-19 que essas
lacunas de dados se tornam particularmente problemáticas porque as
desigualdades levam os menos privilegiados ao mais alto nível de risco
para o vírus, e levam às piores conseqüências socioeconômicas da
pandemia.[^299]

A geografia digital do país indica um panorama de desigualdades em
relação ao uso da internet[^300], embora nos últimos 15 anos o acesso à
internet tenha atingido 70% dos domicílios.[^301] Por um lado, o Brasil
avançou na criação de leis, normas, políticas e práticas projetadas para
abrir dados[^302], como a criação da Infraestrutura Nacional de Dados
Abertos[^303],a Lei de Acesso à Informação[^304], a Estrutura Civil da
internet[^305], a Política de Dados Abertos[^306], Política de
Governança de Dados[^307],Estratégia Digital do Governo[^308] e a
implementação do 4º Plano Nacional de Parceria com a Parceria Aberta do
Governo.[^309] Por outro lado, no entanto, continua a haver uma
estratificação digital no país que coincide com as desigualdades na
distribuição de renda e que se reflete na escassa capacidade de ser
parte ativa na economia digital e na produção formal de dados. O custo
da ["]{dir="rtl"}banda larga" é outro fator que afeta as desigualdades
de acesso, com as áreas rurais ou periféricas sendo penalizadas. Além
disso, os níveis de literacia digital e acessibilidade da internet são
baixos.[^310]

Na região metropolitana de São Paulo, que conta com 12 milhões de
habitantes, a conectividade é superior à média nacional, atingindo 79%
dos domicílios.[^311] Porém, somente a conectividade, no entanto, não é
suficiente para garantir que as pessoas possam se beneficiar da
internet. Além disso, a internet é relevante quando as pessoas têm as
habilidades e a confiança necessárias para usá-la. Em São Paulo, as
oportunidades de acesso e uso da internet aparecem segregadas no
território urbano, seguindo o padrão das desigualdades estruturais
existentes. Isso sugere que, no caso de São Paulo, as desigualdades
relacionadas ao mundo digital são condicionadas pela matriz de
vulnerabilidades que afetam famílias e domicílios no território urbano,
onde os padrões observados reproduzem desigualdades intra-urbanas.

### O ["]{dir="rtl"}Vírus da Desigualdade" {#o-vírus-da-desigualdade .BOOK_Heading-3}

Nesse cenário, a pandemia exacerba as desigualdades existentes. Um exame
mais detalhado da desigualdade e do acesso à internet mostra como os
arredores de São Paulo são o epicentro da propagação de outro vírus ao
lado do COVID-19, que podemos chamar de ["]{dir="rtl"}vírus da
desigualdade". Dados do grupo de pesquisa independente COVID-19
Observatory indicam que na cidade, as pessoas de cor têm 62% mais
chances de morrer do que os brancos.[^312] Se olharmos para o mapa de
mortes confirmadas ou suspeitas de coronavírus nos distritos de São
Paulo, há uma clara sobreposição de desigualdades, ou seja, quanto mais
ampla a matriz de vulnerabilidade social, maior a letalidade do vírus. O
risco de morte por COVID-19 é maior nas regiões Leste, Norte e parte das
regiões Sudeste, onde também são os distritos com maior número de mortes
por COVID-19: Brasilândia e Sapopemba, entre os distritos menos
desenvolvidos da região na cidade de São Paulo.

Caso contrário, grande parte das regiões Sul (centro expandido),
Centro-Oeste e Sudeste, com maior renda per capita, atualmente apresenta
taxas de mortalidade padronizadas abaixo da média municipal.[^313] No
entanto, as condições de moradia são um fator extremamente relevante,
uma vez que os bairros centrais que concentram cortiços, aposentadorias
e pessoas em situação de rua têm um número significativo de mortes. Em
suma, o endereço residencial contribui para definir o impacto do
coronavírus, sua gravidade e letalidade, pois é indicativo de outras
desigualdades persistentes e destrutivas.

Segundo a Secretaria Municipal de Saúde, em 30 de abril, houve um
aumento de 45% nas mortes nos 20 distritos mais pobres da cidade. O
número também pode refletir a distribuição discrepante de unidades de
terapia intensiva na cidade, uma vez que 60% dos leitos do Sistema
Público de Saúde estão concentrados nas regiões mais ricas e centrais da
cidade.

### Rumo a um Regime Sociogital pós COVID-19 {#rumo-a-um-regime-sociogital-pós-covid-19 .BOOK_Heading-3}

O que mais o futuro próximo traz para megacidades como São Paulo? Uma
nova abordagem à governança baseada em dados, que podemos chamar de
regime sociodigital, provavelmente será estendida aos países do
sul.[^314] A pandemia mostrou como estamos vivendo uma nova ordem
social, que combina recursos que facilitam o acesso físico às
tecnologias da informação e comunicação -- infraestrutura de acesso à
internet e habilidades digitais no nível individual. Essas combinações
geram capital digital.[^315] Como os governos não criam políticas ou
incentivos para a infraestrutura de acesso ou a alfabetização digital,
há um esvaziamento do capital digital. Esse déficit é impulsionado pelas
desigualdades estruturais que caracterizam um regime sociodigital. Em
particular, na corrida para criar plataformas de vigilância para
epidemias e sistemas de previsão de emergência, os sistemas de
inteligência artificial (IA) ["]{dir="rtl"}produzem" evidências
políticas projetadas a partir da agregação dos chamados big data[^316] e
outras formas de informações produzidas pelo governo.[^317] No entanto,
os grupos marginalizados e os excluídos digitalmente continuam a
sobreviver dentro das margens impostas pelos regimes sócio-digitais. O
risco de reproduzir e perpetuar desigualdades nos ambientes altamente
tecnológicos do futuro é real e não deve ser subestimado. Grupos
marginalizados sobrevivem em uma complexa matriz de vulnerabilidades,
variando das dimensões econômica, social e jurídica às dimensões
cultural, digital e política. O risco é que dados ausentes ou mesmo
dados mal utilizados se tornem mais um subproduto da desigualdade.

Vários estudos indicam que grupos marginalizados produzem menos dados,
pois não estão envolvidos em atividades de geração de dados, não estão
representados na economia formal, têm acesso desigual e menor capacidade
de se envolver on-line.[^318] Portanto, enquanto mais dados estão
disponíveis para projetar políticas e soluções, e para que os
formuladores de políticas incluam demandas e grupos sociais
historicamente excluídos, os dados acabam reproduzindo os padrões de
discriminação e exclusão presentes no mundo digital, resultando em
políticas públicas potencialmente discriminatórias. Ou seja, ter muitos
dados não significa necessariamente que os dados sejam representativos e
confiáveis ou que os governos possam usá-los.

Então, o que o padrão de desigualdade observado em megacidades como São
Paulo nos diz sobre o futuro dos regimes sociodigitais iminentes?
Reduzir as desigualdades nos centros urbanos é um desafio global,
especialmente no contexto atual em que dados e tecnologias são
combinados com possíveis soluções de emergência resultantes de
desenvolvimentos como mudanças climáticas, desastres tecnológicos e
pandemias. Mas as desigualdades no acesso e no uso da internet revelam a
importância contínua da luta por direitos e acesso a bens, serviços e
oportunidades de qualidade.

Embora coexistam múltiplas desigualdades, as luzes lançadas pelas
desigualdades digitais refletem a falta de políticas públicas efetivas e
eficientes para todos/as. O mundo digital reproduz os modelos de
negócios da economia física, reforçando as lacunas existentes no acesso
aos benefícios. Espera-se que o fim do isolamento também seja o fim do
isolamento dos pobres, negros e desajustados nas cidades. As cidades
estão engajadas na construção de soluções para o rescaldo do COVID-19,
que nos convida a intervenções em educação, saúde, infraestrutura,
participação, colaboração e transparência pública. A construção de
capacidades digitais e responsabilidade compartilhada deve ser uma
característica duradoura dos governos nas cidades.

## COVID-19 Data on the Fringes: The Scottish Story (Angela Daly/Aingeal Ní Dhálaigh)  {#covid-19-data-on-the-fringes-the-scottish-story-angela-dalyaingeal-ní-dhálaigh .BOOK_Heading-2}

COVID-19 hit at a time when the United Kingdom was vulnerable, reeling
from its exit from the European Union and wracked by ongoing issues over
the devolved nations, particularly Northern Ireland and Scotland, both
of which had voted to remain in the EU during the 2016 referendum.
Scotland had its own 2014 referendum on independence from the UK, which
was narrowly won by the "No" side. While a pro-Brexit, right-wing
Conservative government rules in London, the devolved administration in
Edinburgh is led by the center-left Scottish National Party (SNP)
government and first minister Nicola Sturgeon.

However, when the pandemic first hit the UK in the early months of 2020,
there was no discernible difference in approach between the Scottish
government and the UK Government. In March 2020, both Scotland and the
wider UK imposed lockdowns later than in other European countries. By
mid-March, both had abandoned manual contact tracing around the same
time that "Big Tech" firms such as Palantir were invited to meetings
with the UK government.[^319] Later that month, NHSX (the English public
health service unit tasked with setting policy and best practice for
digital technologies and data in health) started developing a
contact-tracing app amid techno-deterministic claims from the Johnson
administration in London that we could digitize our way out of the
pandemic.[^320]

Health is a devolved power in the UK, so the Scottish government has
full responsibility for health policy in Scotland. In May 2020, we began
to see divergence between Scotland the wider UK on pathways out of
lockdown and also on data, with the publication of the Test, Trace,
Isolate, Support policy.[^321] This policy signalled the relaunch of
Scotland's contact tracing scheme, foregrounding manual contact tracing
which may then be supplemented by a "web-based" digital "tool," not an
app. But data in the context of COVID-19 is not solely produced by
contact tracing and apps, even though they have been the focus of
significant debate and advocacy. The data the government releases and
restrains about COVID-19 infections and prevalence also vitally informs
political debates and personal choices. The situation in Scotland
presents a complex picture of the tensions between health, the economy
and politics both at the local and global levels.

### Contact Tracing and the app {#contact-tracing-and-the-app .BOOK_Heading-3}

Scotland's late approach to contact tracing is one of the most prominent
examples of its divergence with the UK central government on COVID-19
data policy. Since May, Scotland has set up its own contact tracing
system to build capacity in its public healthcare service (NHS). This
approach contrasts with the outsourcing of this service to private
companies that has occurred in England. The Scottish government has also
expressed its reservations about the NHSX app and the lack of
consultation with devolved administrations.[^322] However, it still came
as a surprise in August when the Scottish government announced that it
was launching a contact-tracing app and would be adopting the Republic
of Ireland's model and software, developed by Irish company
Nearform.[^323]The Northern Irish administration has also adopted this
model, which makes sense given political and geography, principally the
land border with the Republic. The Scottish government's decision to
adopt the app is more overtly political, since its land border is with
England rather than Ireland. However, the Republic of Ireland's app is
reasonably privacy-protecting through its adoption of the Google-Apple
app protocol. It has decentralized design, is purpose limited, and
already has a track record of functioning reasonably well. The same
cannot be said of the original NHSX app. Even the NHSX app's current
incarnation, released after the Scottish app, still seems to be
suffering from malfunctions.[^324]

The Scottish overnment may have adopted the Republic of Ireland's app
for politically pragmatic reasons, but it leaves the nation in a
position where it has followed the lead of another nation-state rather
than its own central government in London. This has led to a "Gaelic
Fringe" approach to apps and contact tracing across the contested
borders of nation-states in the islands of Britain and Ireland.[^325]
The outcome of this approach may be the establishment of Scotland's
digital sovereignty in a similar way to the movement in Catalonia,
another separatist region in Spain.[^326] This is all the more
significant, given Scottish Parliament elections in 2021 that the SNP
are tipped to win by a landslide, and calls for another independence
referendum, in which polls consistently show a pro-independence vote in
the lead.

Yet the need to adhere to the Google-Apple protocol in order to create
functioning apps does limit political entities' digital sovereignty,
both of Scotland and full nation-states which have had to use this
protocol for their own apps. The Google-Apple protocol has promoted a
measure of privacy protection sorely lacking in the UK Government's
initial NHSX app. Still, the need to adopt this protocol for a
successful app demonstrates and reinforces the power of "Big Tech"
firms.

### Government Transparency {#government-transparency .BOOK_Heading-3}

The Scottish government has undoubtedly been more transparent about its
COVID-19 app than its counterparts in London have been about the NHSX
app. A series of *openDemocracy* investigations have demonstrated that
"Big Tech" firms provided digital infrastructure to manage the
pandemic.[^327] However, the Scottish government does not have a
flawless record on its own transparency during this period. In Scotland,
freedom of information (FoI) laws were relaxed at the outbreak of the
pandemic in April, allowing government agencies a threefold extension to
their deadlines for responding to freedom of information requests. These
measures were strongly criticized at the time.[^328] Even the UK
government did not relax FoI laws to the same extent. The Index on Free
Expression criticized the Scottish government, comparing it to
Bolsonaro's Brazil for its restrictions of freedom of information rights
during the pandemic.[^329]

Access to public data and information extends beyond FoI. Who is
infected with COVID-19, who has died from it, and where have been key
questions to ask in order to understand whether certain groups have been
more impacted than others.[^330] In England, people from Black and
Minority Ethnic (BAME) backgrounds have been more susceptible to
infection and death from COVID-19 for reasons including socio-economic
circumstances, structural racism, and pre-existing health
inequalities.[^331] Scotland has a significant minority population of
South Asian origin, and there was anecdotal evidence in spring 2020 that
this community was experiencing a disproportionate amount of COVID-19
deaths. The Coalition for Racial Equality and Rights (CRER), a Scottish
NGO, raised concerns about the lack of data and the poor quality of the
data that did exist.[^332] Finally, in July the National Record of
Scotland published a study on ethnicity and COVID-19 in Scotland which
found that South Asian people were nearly twice as likely to die of
COVID-19.[^333] This finding is in line with outcomes in other parts of
the UK, but the Scottish data was made available later than elsewhere.
CRER is still calling for more and better data to be generated and
released on COVID-19 and ethnicity in Scotland.[^334]

### Data and Marketization {#data-and-marketization .BOOK_Heading-3}

For contact tracing, the Scottish government has followed a less
neoliberal and privatized approach to England, where these functions
have been outsourced to private companies. However, marketization and
privatisation of other public functions have obfuscated what data is
available to the public in Scotland. Like elsewhere in the UK and other
western countries, care homes for the elderly and disabled have been
severely impacted by COVID-19, with many residents dying of the
disease. One notorious example is the private Home Farm care home on the
Isle of Skye, where ten residents died of the virus. It was run by
HC-One, one of the UK's largest care home providers.[^335] Care home
regulatory bodies in both England and Scotland have refused to make
public the numbers of deaths in specific care homes, with part of the
justification being that this would negatively affect providers'
commercial interests.[^336]

While so far not as deadly, marketized universities in Scotland brought
students back to campus for the start of the new academic year and have
experienced COVID-19 outbreaks in shared student accommodation from
September 2020.[^337] There has been patchy information about COVID-19
cases among campus communities; some institutions have released this
data and others have not, leading to the UniCOVID site set up by two
University of Sussex academics to track developments.[^338] It seems
that universities are becoming more forthcoming about tracking their own
COVID-19 outbreaks and releasing data publicly. However, there is no
systematic way to track data, and not every institution is readily
providing it. Marketisation of this public service has led to students
returning prematurely to campuses and may have contributed to
institutions' reticence in compiling and publicising data about COVID-19
cases.

The Scottish digital story demonstrates a different path from that of
the UK central government. Notably, the approach to contact tracing
remains within the public health service rather than being outsourced to
private providers, yet also represents a radical alignment with Dublin
on the app. Along with the Belfast administration's embrace of the
Nearform software, we see a "Gaelic Fringe" approach to contact-tracing
apps emerging, which is also in line with European standards more
generally, and thus represents further cleavage from the pro-Brexit
London government. While the Scottish government may have adopted this
approach for pragmatic reasons, in outcome it may be seen as a further
step towards Scotland's digital sovereignty.

The worst excesses of the UK government's privatized and digitized
COVID-19 response have not been replicated in Scotland, but things have
not been perfect either. Transparency, who is counted in data, and what
data is available to the public have been influenced negatively by
logics of privatisation and marketization in public functions,
particularly in care homes. The needs of ethnic minorities to be counted
and made visible in data, when COVID-19 has disproportionately affected
them, were not adequately addressed and taken account of by the Scottish
government. Scotland shows the potential for the margins to forge
different paths on data than the cores. However, Scotland also
demonstrates the limits of independence in a world of "Big Tech,"
neoliberal logics, and inequalities. With COVID-19, data is power and
data is political---this is as true in Scotland as it is elsewhere.

## Pandemic Paternalism: A Reflection on Indigenous Data from Aotearoa (Donna Cormack & Tahu Kukutai) {#pandemic-paternalism-a-reflection-on-indigenous-data-from-aotearoa-donna-cormack-tahu-kukutai .BOOK_Heading-2}

There are estimated to be more than 300 million Indigenous people in the
world, spanning every continent, each with diverse histories and
socio-political contexts.[^339] The shared experiences of imperialism
and colonialism have profoundly impacted Indigenous peoples' health and
well-being, producing enduring disparities in most territories.[^340]
COVID-19 has sharpened structural inequalities, and Indigenous peoples
in many countries have been disproportionately impacted by the pandemic,
either directly (through infection and fatalities) or indirectly, by way
of economic losses, social disruption, and discrimination.[^341]
Indigenous peoples have also experienced pandemic-related data
injustices. Focusing on Aotearoa (New Zealand), this essaexplores how
hegemonic knowledge production practices have resulted in inequitable
access to data about COVID-19 by Indigenous Māori communities. This
inequity is situated within the wider context of ongoing colonialism,
epistemic injustice, and the continuing resistance of Indigenous
peoples.

As a member of the so-called "Digital 9" network, Aotearoa is considered
one of the world's most digitally-advanced nations. Over the last
decade, the government has eagerly embraced the use of "big data" in
decision-making. Stats NZ, the national statistics office, is home to
the world-leading Integrated Data Infrastructure (IDI), which links
de-identified microdata about people and households from government
datasets. Aotearoa is also one of few countries with a system-wide
approach to collecting multiple measures of ethnicity and Indigeneity
for use in public policy. Such data are used to monitor the government's
obligations to Māori under the country's founding document, the 1840
Treaty of Waitangi.[^342] Given these features, one might expect
Aotearoa to be an exemplar when it comes to producing high-quality,
timely and relevant COVID-19 data about (and for) Indigenous peoples.
Unfortunately, this has not been the case.

Early on in the pandemic, it became apparent that ethnicity data was not
being routinely collected or reported for all COVID-19 related
activities or outcomes,[^343] despite ethnicity data collection being
mandatory in the health sector for more than 20 years.[^344] Initially,
no ethnicity data was reported in the Ministry of Health's daily
updates. While cases are now reported by ethnicity for the six major
ethnic groupings, this granularity has not carried over to other key
indicators. Six months on, Māori data are still not reported in a way
that readily allows for stratified analysis by other variables such as
age and region. A lack of complete data reporting makes it challenging
for Māori organisations and providers engaged in the pandemic response
to make detailed assessments of how COVID-19 is affecting their
communities.

Māori carry an elevated risk of harm, while being excluded from
decision-making to mitigate that harm---an all-too familiar situation.
There is a long-standing colonial predilection for seeing Indigenous
peoples as objects to be known---never as experts in their own
right.[^345] We should not be surprised that inequitable knowledge
production practices are being replayed in the context of COVID-19 data.
As Carroll, Rodriguez-Lonebear & Martinez argue, settler colonial
governments routinely produce Indigenous data that are not fit to meet
the priorities of Indigenous communities.[^346] Such data tends to be of
lower quality than non-Indigenous data, since they are inconsistently
measured, difficult to access, and controlled by non-Indigenous people
and systems. All of these issues have prevailed in Aotearoa, to some
extent, during COVID-19.

It is also clear that the substantial investment in data linkage and
integration, ostensibly to inform government decision-making, has failed
to produce reliable data for Māori decision-makers. High-quality,
disaggregated Māori and iwi (tribal) data was needed in near real-time
to guide immediate responses at local, regional, and national levels.
For many iwi and Māori communities this data did not materialize, even
as they repeatedly demonstrated innovative modes of distributed
leadership and a deep capacity to care for each other. Instead, Māori
largely relied on their own local intelligence networks and collective
knowledge of kin relations, beyond the purview of government agencies
and their data systems.

Issues of trust, control, and authority also bubbled to the surface in
the pandemic response. To date, there has been little meaningful
engagement with principles of Māori Data Sovereignty[^347] in
decision-making through the data systems for the pandemic response,
including the COVID-19 tracer app released by the Ministry of
Health.[^348] This lack of engagement persists, despite an increasing
number of government agencies purporting to support Maori data
sovereignty, including a Stats NZ-led initiative to implement a Māori
data governance model across the official government data system.[^349]
In times of crisis, those in positions of power often default to the
status quo. State institutions seem to find it difficult to accept that
Māori have technical expertise and deep contextual knowledge that would
be beneficial to data systems and practices during the pandemic. As we
continue to move through the pandemic, the government needs to shift its
focus from centralized data systems that aid top-down policy-making to a
more nimble and empowering approach that supports Māori-controlled data
systems and locally-defined interventions.

The COVID-19 response in Aotearoa has revealed the persistence of forms
of epistemic exclusion.[^350] Māori knowers and knowledges have been
marginalized, and unjust data practices continue to privilege the
priorities of the dominant Pākehā (NZ European) population and wilfully
ignore Māori data rights.[^351] It is an important reminder that systems
designed for settler colonial goals will work in service of those goals.
There remains an urgent need for Indigenous data governance and
community-controlled data infrastructure that will serve broader Māori
goals of self-determination.

*\"Please show your Health Code.\" Almost all public places in China
have posted such requests at the entrances nowadays. Health Code, a

movements and curb the coronavirus\'s spread. A local government then
proposed a Gradient Health Code to rank citizens based on smoking,
sleeping, and medical records.*

"请出示你的健康码"，在新冠肺炎大流行的几个月后，中国几乎所有的公共场所的入口都张贴着这样的要求。健康码，一个通过支付宝、微信小程序、各地应用程序等接口，在授权国家政务服务平台获取姓名、身份证号以及手机号码后就可以被分配到的码。绿色代码，意味着自由出行。黄色或红色代码，意味着不同程度的感染新冠病毒的风险。[^352]

健康码呈现出了另一种新的监视状态：你无需任何自主填写和参与。健康码的诞生并不在你授权的那刻，而是在那之前。它的使用环境也并不随着你的行为习惯，而是一种强制性的公民义务："没有绿码，无法进入。"

## Data Cudgel or how to Generate Corona-Compliance in Israel (Alex Gekker & Anat Ben-David) {#data-cudgel-or-how-to-generate-corona-compliance-in-israel-alex-gekker-anat-ben-david .BOOK_Heading-2}

With the rapid unfolding of the COVID-19 global pandemic, Israel was one
of the first states outside East-Asia to impose involuntary surveillance
measures as a means to combat the virus. Crucially, the government
utilized the country's permanent state of exception to bypass the
parliament and deploy a hitherto classified anti-terrorism tool
developed by its internal security service (Shin Bet) to track the
location of coronavirus patients, identify infection-chains and notify
citizens who have been in close proximity to an identified patient to
self-quarantine.[^360] Despite the marked similarity to the Snowden
revelations[^361] in terms of scope and granularity of data available to
secret services on individuals, the extreme measures undertaken by the
Israeli government were met by a legal battle ensued by a small group of
activists and civil society organizations, but not by a public outcry.
Rather, the majority of Israelis were willing to compromise their right
to privacy for the technological protection[^362] offered against the
virus, and expressed high levels of trust in the Shin Bet, even as the
latter was often reluctant to take up the mantle.[^363] In this essay we
use historian Daniel Rosenberg's notion of "data after the fact" to
reflect on how various uses of (big) data in Israel have led to
compliance and confusion for the people involved.[^364]

Rosenberg suggests that data came to be a historically recognised
category that is "given" ("data" means "that which is given" in Latin
and thus not questioned or interrogated. Only *the results* coming from
the data are. Recently, with the rise of massive data collection and
machine learning techniques, data has further changed meaning, but
retained that historically grounded sense of objectivity. This joins the
tendency of computers being seen as "accurate" and "unbiased"---
consider how Facebook claims that no user privacy is breeched because no
humans are involved in seeing one's personal details. Wendy Hui Kyong
Chun and David Berry suggest that computer software becomes ingrained in
the very language and metaphors of how we think about "thinking"
today.[^365] Various data dashboards, including in combating Corona,
cement the data-reflected reality rather than being tools for discussing
alternatives. In the Israeli case, the discussion of possible responses
to COVID-19 and their implications became entangled with the
computerised data gathered on the disease's spread, in a way that
limited potential objections to the measures imposed. We show this
across three distinct episodes.

### Shin Bet Surveillance {#shin-bet-surveillance .BOOK_Heading-3}

After a publication by investigative journalists, the Shin Bet's
surveillance system was exposed.[^366] Called simply "the Tool" it has
been in operation since 2002 and used for continuous trawling collection
of all available cell-phone data from every mobile device in Israel and
the Palestinian Territories. Officially used for counter-terrorism and
previously (officially) used only targeted surveillance on specific
individuals and in relation to a case, the [T]{dir="rtl"}ool has
nonetheless been employed for digital contact tracing across the entire
land and marketed as an emergency extreme measure that is nonetheless a
"magic bullet" solution. Specifically the "Tool" allowed avoiding the
need to deploy a voluntary digital contact tracing apps as done by other
democratic states.[^367] Nonetheless such a civilian, Bluetooth-based
phone app was developed, failed and re-developed again to a minimal
reception by the Ministry of Health.[^368] One of the central arguments
against adopting this latter, privacy preserving option, was due to the
fact that the Shin Bet is collecting all data anyway. Yet, being a
secret government agency, the Shin Bet is reluctant to share the
specifics of the data collected. Early reports indicate a 5% wide margin
of error.[^369] Out of 71 thousand people required to self-quarantine
based on the tool's data in the first week of July alone, about 22
thousand appealed, claiming to be false positives, and 60% of those
appeals were accepted. Overall, the data presented of the effectives of
the tool was lacking, included repeated numbers in different categories,
and was unreliable^.^[^370] Nonetheless, the appearance of efficiency
supported by seemingly impressive numerical data has led to a continuing
adaption of the tool instead of other alternatives.

### National Compliance Index {#national-compliance-index .BOOK_Heading-3}

Another use of numerical data to create compliance rather than support
policy was through the deployment of a "national index"[^371], in
cooperation with renowned behavioral economist Dan Arieli's Kayma
company.[^372] []{dir="rtl"}The index was developed by Kayma as a single
entrant to an urgent tandem presented by Israel's National Corona
Response Centre. Despite potential financial and practical concerns, the
company was selected to monitor various "commercial and civilian data
sources" in order to track how compliant the population is with Covid
regulations.[^373] Prominent on various platforms---including on the
main page of the country's most-read news website---and asking citizens
to self-report on "compliance" such as hand-washing or mask-wearing, the
index generates a variety of dashboard statistics, while being extremely
opaque in its data sources. As in the previous case, the numerical data,
information visualizations and dashboards derived from the index were
available to the citizens only in their final, "ready-made" state, such
as "what is the level of compliance to the lockdown in your home city
compared to other cities"? discouraging reflection and encouraging the
very thing they were supposedly measuring -- compliance.

### Lack of Ministry of Health Data {#lack-of-ministry-of-health-data .BOOK_Heading-3}

Many of the unclarities above could have been addressed -- or at least
mitigated -- by clear and transparent reporting of Covid-19 infections
and transmissions data by the governmental body responsible, Ministry of
Health (MoH). Yet, despite repeated requests, throughout the first month
of pandemic the data was published by the ministry's spokesperson as
cropped images on the ministry's Telegram channel. This required a
dedicated manual input of the information by volunteers to keep track of
the official numbers. Even later, with a new updated data dashboard,
users could not receive numerical information and moreover each new
version overwrote the previous one.[^374] Data scientist Dan Bareket who
kept those previous versions manually has shown that there are gross
differences between those older and newer versions.[^375]

Those episodes come together to showcases how data can be wielded as a
cudgel rather than a precise tool: collected through undisclosed means
and used to create popular compliance, suppressing discussions of
measures or alternatives.

## Making Sense of the Pandemic Through Data: The Italian Case (Tiziano Bonini) {#making-sense-of-the-pandemic-through-data-the-italian-case-tiziano-bonini .BOOK_Heading-2}

Forms of datafication during the COVID-19 pandemic have varied by
country. The biggest concerns relating to datafication of citizens were
the spread of contact tracing apps, and how they would potentially harm
citizens' privacy. Some have suggested that people have become passively
accustomed to surveillance by private multinational companies[^376] but
are reluctant to agree to be monitored by their country's Ministry of
Health.

In Italy, as in many other countries, many controversies have arisen
around health-tracking apps. In the end, the Italian app Immuni was
released on June 2, 2020, and in eight days it was downloaded by two
million Italian citizens.[^377] While this might seem like a success
story, the reality is more complicated. Experts pointed out that at
least 30 million downloads would be needed to make the app useful for
contact tracing.[^378] There are many doubts about the possibility of
reaching these numbers, partly because older smartphone models do not
support the app.

Debate on the Immuni app has revealed two opposing fronts; we can refer
to them as the techno-solutionists on the one hand, and the
techno-apocalyptics on the other. The former believe they can slow down
the diffusion of contagion simply by having an app installed on their
mobile phones. The latter reject any form of surveillance, except that
coming from Facebook or Google. Yet, the importance of data during the
pandemic did not emerge only during the debate on Immuni. These public
narratives of the lockdown period were influenced by the rhetoric of
dataism---a blind and unconditional trust in data.

Every evening for two months at 6:30 PM, the head of the Italian Civil
Protection went on television to "give numbers" about the pandemic. They
discussed recovered patients, new contagions, newly hospitalized, and
new deaths compared to the previous day. Despite the dubious reliability
of those data---it was later discovered there were many more deaths, the
contagions were ten times as many, and Italian regions did not provide
data in a homogeneous way[^379]---this press conference turned into a
collective ritual. It was an appointment not to be missed, like
President Roosevelt's fireside chats on the radio, a real "media
event"[^380]: the pandemic ceremony. His national ceremony was flanked
by other media micro-cerimonies. Dozens of Italian mayors, inspired by
the macabre national ceremony, every night "entertained" their fellow
citizens through live-shows on Facebook, You Tube and Instagram. They
told citizens about the state of the virus spread in their municipality
through use of data. In these cases, data was described as producing
objective and neutral facts to convince citizens to stay at home and
"flatten the curve."

But if we stoped here, we would end up seeing only a part of the
story---the story in which data was used to build a public narrative
that was passively accepted by citizens. That's not the case, or at
least it wasn't for everyone. Since the early days of the pandemic and
lockdown, organized groups of citizens have tried to analyse available
data together, drawing different conclusions from the official
narrative, or even producing new data. Many have opened Excel
spreadsheets where they could download Civil Protection data (made
available as open data) to interpret them independently.

Others have created Facebook groups to discuss such data and their
meaning. They turned to their math friend, dusted off their old
statistical knowledge, or simply followed the home-made analyses of
their Facebook friends. From this point of view, we could say that the
lockdown represented a period of collective learning about the role of
data in society and accelerated the emergence or spread of data
activism, data journalism, and open science practices.

On the side of data journalism, the local newspaper *L'Eco di Bergamo*
conducted important investigative work. By collecting data independently
and examining data already available, it showed that the number of
deaths in the province of Bergamo---one of the most affected cities in
Italy by COVID-19---was almost double the official statistic. On the
open science and citizen science side, one of the most active groups in
Italy was the Facebook group Dataninja, a community of journalists,
citizens and researchers created in 2012 by a group of Italian
journalists interested in using data to create information. For two
months this community, numbering more than 3,000 members, produced data,
graphs, and tables---a collective effort to try to make sense of what
was happening.

Within the medical community, other interesting projects related to data
emerged. The Giotto Movement in Modena was created by an association of
young Italian family doctors with the aim of building together a shared
Excel sheet that tallied the suspected COVID-19 patients that didn't
match the official criteria to be eligible for a COVID-19 test and were
taken care of by the Public Health and Hygiene Service. This need was
felt by several family doctors, who (simultaneously and without
consulting each other) created very similar "low technology" tools to
keep track of the situation. These were the first weeks of emergency and
the situation on the ground was very chaotic. The project evolved in
three main phases:

-   Consultation: young doctors from various Italian regions defined a
    first version of the register.

-   Testing: a group of about 20 couples of doctors training in General
    Medicine tested the instrument for a week and then built the final
    version of the register.

-   Diffusion: the register was shared with all family doctors.

On the side of data activism, since March 12 the NGO Action Aid has
activated a national mapping of spontaneous and institutional solidarity
initiatives. These initiatives include volunteers doing shopping for the
elderly, providing psychological support, fundraising, debunking fake
news, and sharing scientific data. The project is named COVID-19 Italia
Help, and consists of an interactive map[^381] in which anyone can
report and map Italian solidarity initiatives. The creators of the
project described it as a "civic hacking" initiative, and the idea came
from the same team that had developed the EarthQuakeCentroItalia
project, which used open data and citizen generated data to respond to
the Earthquake that struck Central Italy in 2016.[^382]

In Bologna, the working cooperative Kilowatt launched the project "Passa
il tempo, passa la bufera," an experiment in domestic ethnography "at a
distance," to stimulate a ritual of collective self-observation.
Kilowatt collected qualitative data through online questionnaires with
open-ended questions, renewed once a week for five weeks. The 583
respondents provided detailed accounts of their lives during lockdown,
changes in their moods, and their new domestic occupations. Data
collected was then translated into info-graphics and collective diaries,
which gave a collective portrait of the domestic climate during the
pandemic. Kilowatt's aim was to try to keep the pulse of what was
happening in our homes and in our lives, accompanying us to a new
normality, going beyond the logic of statistics and using the tools of
ethnography.

I talked over email with two of the creators of the project, Anna Romani
and Gaspare Caliri. They told me that the answers to the last
questionnaire clearly confirmed people's need for others and need for
solitude---two indivisible and necessary feelings during the lockdown.
They also noticed that the respondents feared that nothing will change:
"we often hear this, but especially in relation not only to macro
issues, but also to the individual management of one's own days, after
having discovered the special texture of slow, freed time, time to lose,
time for idleness, time for oneself, time for loved ones." According to
Caliri, "the instrument of domestic ethnography worked as a detector of
the so-called warm data[^383], the Bateson Institute would say, i.e.
those relational data that give meaning (intelligibility) to a complex
system and the possibility of collective learning: those data where the
important thing is the connection, not the point." In other words, they
employed domestic ethnography as a "technology of the self"[^384],
meaning the activity of taking care of oneself during lockdown went
through individual generation and collective analysis of qualitative
data (the diaries).

These examples are only the surface of a process of domestication of
data within daily life during the pandemic. They are significant because
they show the ability and willingness of people to exercise agency with
respect to data produced by institutions and narrated by the media.
These examples show the need to negotiate, appropriate, decode, and
rework data coming from above and, in some cases, produce new meanings
of data. The collective process of producing knowledge about the virus
has been largely based on the capacity of sharing and interpreting data.
What I wanted to show here is slightly different: that private and
collective initiatives from civil society have partly taken away the
monopoly of production, analysis, and verification of data by
institutions. Moreover, these examples also provide evidence that not
all social formations have adhered to blind faith in data and technology
as a solution to the COVID-19 crisis.

## Contact Tracing Apps and "Good Data"? The Case of Australia's COVIDSafe app (Alexandra Elliott) {#contact-tracing-apps-and-good-data-the-case-of-australias-covidsafe-app-alexandra-elliott .BOOK_Heading-2}

A man decides to go grocery shopping during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Despite his best efforts to be cautious he comes within 1.5 meters with
another shopper while reaching for a basket. It happens again when
selecting his milk, and two more times when squeezing through the
crowded cereal aisle, and as he pays for his groceries. He then returns
home to hugs from his wife and three kids. A few days later the man
tests positive for COVID-19 and all those he came into contact with may
potentially also be sick. Each of these people has their own web of
contacts, and this is only from the contacts made within one hour.

Contact tracing helps detect cases of COVID-19, treat them early, and
reduce further contamination---essential to overcome the pandemic.
However, it is clear that contact tracing is no easy feat. With the
total cases worldwide exceeding 7 million, it seems reasonable to adopt
the assistance of technology in contact tracing efforts. So why is there
so much contention over implementing contact-tracing apps?[^385]

In an attempt to assess whether contact-tracing technologies should be
met with approval, I will position it within academic notions of "Good
Data." Through a case study of Australia's COVIDSafe app, I hope to
reach an understanding of why this technique is an essential tool in
minimising the curve of the Coronavirus, "a strategy that goes
hand-in-hand with economic recovery and reducing the isolation
recommendations that are currently in place".[^386] I will then explore
the concerns and controversies preventing unanimous enthusiasm about the
process, presenting both the arguments and their rebuttals to paint a
comprehensive portrait.

With the rise in suspicions over "Big Tech" and their manipulative and
invasive data practices, a counteractive field of academia has emerged
to discuss the ethical uses of data. There are discrepancies over the
definitions found within the discourse, including terms like responsible
data[^387], good data[^388], data justice[^389]. For example, one of the
central ideas of the field can be found within the work of Taylor and
Purtova[^390], who divide data justice into data responsibility and
data sustainability. The first covers the impact of data on the user
(for example, matters of privacy and bias) and the latter refers to
utilising data for the benefit of society. Many scholars have called for
a unified understanding to accelerate the application of these ideas.
For clarity, I unite these concepts under the label "Good Data."

### Big Data as Public Good {#big-data-as-public-good .BOOK_Heading-3}

To illustrate how contact-tracing apps are a sustainable data practice,
I approach them as an implementation of \"big data as a public
good."[^391] That is, the information that "big data" provides can be
utilized for the benefit of society. However, the societal benefits of
data access for humanitarian purposes is difficult to achieve, due to
the clashing responsibilities and ambitions of the various actors
involved. Taylor and Ritchie and Welpton[^392] have both attempted to
navigate these relationships and assess the likelihood of the exposure
of personal datasets to benefit humanity.

Many papers dissect the data collection and analysis ecosystem of mobile
operators and other "Big Tech" companies. If, upon release, data held by
corporations can promote "social good"[^393], such as by sending
emergency alerts, then it should be made available. But this may not be
in the best interests of the data's private owners. The responsibility
of ensuring privacy lays with the data owner, who can hesitate to
release information for fear it sullies their reputation. We therefore
have encountered a roadblock to sharing data for humanitarian
endeavours.

COVIDSafe provides an alternative, more harmonious model of data as
public good by eliminating private ownership. The data it collects is
analysed by the Australian government for the benefit of the Australian
people. The government accepts the responsibility of individuals'
privacy. Unlike other cases involving numerous differing parties who
collect the data and who analyse and use the data, the government's
goals align with a need to protect the Australian population. There is
no longer a need for repurposing. Through COVIDSafe, an entirely new
dataset is being collected, designed for the purpose of contact tracing,
and therefore facilitating the process of data for the public good.

### Contact Tracing {#contact-tracing .BOOK_Heading-3}

Contact tracing involves identifying people who have been in contact
with an infectious person[^394] so that they can isolate themselves and
halt the spread. The process ultimately seeks to control the spread of a
disease or virus and can be automated by smartphone tracking apps.
Tracking people can be achieved over either Bluetooth or GPS. Bluetooth
offers more privacy, since it does not record the location at which
contact occurred. Alternatively, others argue for GPS[^395] and its
ability to identify viral hotspots. Up until recently, Apple's iOS
software blocked Bluetooth from running in the background of apps. This
would have rendered contact-tracing apps ineffective as the app needed
to always be open to detect contacts. They have now removed that
function[^396][,]{.ul} thus supporting the development and use of
tracing applications. Once in operation, a phone with a contact-tracing
app will send out a code through Bluetooth to any other phone with the
app that comes near.

###  {#section-20 .BOOK_Heading-3}

### COVIDSafe {#covidsafe .BOOK_Heading-3}

Australia's government and health authorities have adopted the COVIDSafe
app as a tool to contain and hopefully overcome Coronavirus in the
country. Its endorsement has been strong, driven by widespread
advertisements encouraging Australians to download the app, and the
Prime Minister Scott Morrison appealing to the public with assurances
that the more people that use the app the more quickly the pubs can
reopen.[^397] COVIDSafe works by recognising other devices in its
proximity with the app installed. "It notes the date, time, distance and
duration of the contact and the other user's reference code."[^398] The
reference code is anonymous and refreshed every two hours, the data
collected is encrypted, and the information is deleted after 21 days.

From both the COVIDSafe website and statements by the government, it is
clear that those involved are aware of users' concerns about
infringement of privacy. The Guardian recently conducted a survey, which
found that 57% of respondents were anxious about the security protecting
their personal information.[^399] In an attempt to quell concerns, both
a Privacy Policy and Privacy Impact Assessment Report are available to
read and users may opt out at any time and request the immediate
deletion of their records.[^400] Furthermore, it is a criminal offence
to use the data collection for any purpose other than contact tracing,
and by actors other than those delegated.

Regardless of these protections, COVIDSafe is not open-source software,
prompting critics to argue that it "is not subject to audit or
oversight."[^401] The reason privacy protection is so critical is that
the data collected constructs a "comprehensible social contacts map of
the nation."[^402] A dataset of Australians' behavioural patterns could
be a valuable resource for a range of purposes from marketing to more
malicious uses.

Since its appearance in the app store, COVIDSafe has experienced a
number of setbacks. Hoax texts distributed a message to users reading
"the COVIDSafe app has detected you are now +20km from your nominated
home address.'[^403] Revelations emerged that the users' phone make and
model was communicated unencrypted.[^404] There was also backlash in the
media about the choice to store the data in the American-owned Amazon
Web Services (AWS) over Australian providers.[^405] Concerns were raised
about the lost opportunity to support local businesses, and over
information being accessed by American entities due to legislation
approving government access to data held by US-owned companies. However,
there remains ambiguity surrounding the matter, as AWS are already used
for a range of Australian federal operations and the transferring of
COVIDSafe data to any country is prohibited through the Biosecurity Act.

Research has confirmed that certain user numbers must be attainted
before contact-tracing apps can be labelled as effective. The University
of Oxford conducted an experiment on a simulated city to reveal that 80%
of smartphone users in the UK---or 56% of the population---must be using
the app for it to be successful in curbing the spread of the
Coronavirus.[^406] Unfortunately this cannot be enforced, it is
important to ensure downloading the app is voluntary to maintain civil
liberties.[^407]

User numbers may be inhibited by scepticism throughout society towards
the government and "Big Tech," who use surveillance to monitor our daily
routines and, consequently, impart a reluctance to participate.[^408]
Furthermore, there is a high correlation between people who don't own a
smartphone and those at high risk of contracting COVID-19---particularly
older generations and the poor. Contact tracing apps therefore fail to
detect and protect potentially severe cases. The limitations of the
technology present another problem. Bluetooth range extends beyond 1.5
metres, and also permeates through walls, creating false positives.
Numbers may also be inaccurately inflated through "self-diagnosing
incorrectly or worse, trolls spamming the system."[^409] False positives
need to be avoided, not only for the efficiency of the operation, but
also to not lose the faith of users.

### In Conclusion {#in-conclusion .BOOK_Heading-3}

If assessing contact-tracing apps based off their ethics, COVIDSafe
would be considered a golden example of "Good Data." However, following
Taylor and Purtova, it is not only sustainability at stake, but also the
responsibility that must be met to attain a holistic "Good Data"
practice.[^410] Concerns over confidentiality and inaccuracies prevent
contact-tracing apps from easily being categorized as "good." However,
what if the equal weighting of responsibility and sustainability is not
fixed? Extenuating circumstances often mean we must prioritize and
compromise. Contact tracing apps are an example of foregoing
responsibility to the individual for sustainability of the whole
population. Additionally, incorporation of decentralized storage allows
people to choose from a pool of suppliers to align with their values,
providing an exit strategy. Such a decision would mean data is not
stored post-virus[^411], and inviting collaboration could ensure a more
trustworthy model of contact tracing.[^412] Trust has become
particularly important, because the public needs to trust their
government and health services to utilize this data for the benefit of
the public. It is important to maintain perspective and remember what is
at stake. In times of crisis, we may comply with conditions otherwise
worth challenging. Sacrifices and personal discomfort may be necessary
and worthwhile if they lead to overcoming and healing from COVID-19.

## Solutionism, Surveillance, Borders and Infrastructures in the "Datafied Pandemic" (Philip Di Salvo)  {#solutionism-surveillance-borders-and-infrastructures-in-the-datafied-pandemic-philip-di-salvo .BOOK_Heading-2}

The COVID-19 pandemic has been a prism and an amplifier for anything
data. It has exposed underlying issues that require the attention of
academics, activists, journalists, and policy makers. Health emergencies
are enormous stress tests for civil rights and freedoms, and for the
platforms through which societies come together. With most of the world
population under lockdown or subjected to monitoring, digital platforms
and internet infrastructures have become leading spaces where social
life takes place. This may sound obvious now, but as Franco "Bifo"
Berardi wrote in his pandemic-influenced book *Fenomenologia della
fine*, COVID-19 globally recodified the assumptions of our societies, so
we must consider their datafied sides.[^413] While we live on the
internet more than ever, access to tools, basic services, and social
environments is becoming increasingly unequal. Such inequalities have
increased due to the uneven distribution of opportunities, resources,
and the exclusive design of socially-impactful technologies.

In a piece for *Open Democracy* written from the Dutch and Italian
lockdowns last spring, Stefania Milan and I tried to identify "four
enemies" from the pandemic in the context of the "datafied
society."[^414] Back then, we claimed that the pandemic was accelerating
"potentially dangerous dynamics" capable of causing huge collective
damage. In the fall of 2020, those dynamics apparently exploded in plain
sight, exacerbated by the long-awaited "second wave" of the virus and
political intervention worldwide. As we expected, the pandemic
reformulated the relationships between tech, power, and justice, as
claimed by Linnet Taylor, Gargi Sharma, Aaron Martin, and Shazade
Jameson in their book *Data Justice and COVID-19: Global
Perspectives*.[^415] The outcomes of these reformulation have not yet
manifested clearly, but their occurrence appears visible in some
domains, especially the most marginalised communities. In this essay, I
will discuss four keywords: solutionism, surveillance, borders, and
infrastructures.

### Solutionism {#solutionism .BOOK_Heading-3}

The pandemic has been accompanied by a new wave of solutionism in policy
making, healthcare, and beyond. Solutionism has been described by Evgeny
Morozov as the the "idea that given the right code, algorithms and
robots, technology can solve all of mankind\'s problems."[^416] We heard
lots of these calls during the pandemic, especially when the release of
contact-tracing apps were heralded as the "silver bullet" to the spread
of the pandemic. In Italy, the government adopted privacy-respectful
solutions and frameworks for its national app Immuni ("the immune
ones"). However, the sensitivity of the Italian app development came
only from weeks of pressure from privacy activists, academics, and
journalists to avoid more invasive software solutions. Even in an
established democracy, China was frequently described as a model to
follow, especially in regards to the tracking of citizens during the
pandemic. Although that pressure led to better decisions and an improved
app, privacy and surveillance are not the only potential problems in
regards to these apps. Whereas they're undoubtedly effective to trace
cases and are one more solution that states can adopt in the battle
against COVID-19, they're not the most fundamental solution.

Even when privacy-respectful, contact tracing apps may exclude enormous
segments of the population: Singapore has been an interesting and
dramatic case study in these regards, also because the city has been
frequently indicated as an excellent example in the response to the
pandemic, especially in regards to technology usage. As the BBC reports,
though, "success crumbled when the virus reached its many foreign worker
dormitories" that are home to over 300,000 low-wage foreign workers,
living in inadequate conditions where social distancing is impossible
and contact-tracing apps fail in their mission.[^417] As the cases
number in the dorms sky-rocketed, Singapore authorities started
releasing different statistics about the contagion: one about the city
community, and one about the population in dorms. Excluded from any form
of assistance and prevention, foreing workers were even hidden from the
main data, ending up in dedicated statistics highlighting a clear
inequality pattern. Stories of exclusion and blatant inequality related
to technological responses to the pandemic have emerged from all over
the world and also in developed and fully democratic countries. In
Canada, for instance, it has been reported that the national
contact-tracing app was released in French and English only, signaling
another sign of exclusion for the four million Canadians who do not
command those languages.[^418] In the UK, an expert board reporting to
the government highlighted that some 21% of the UK adults do not use a
smartphone, de facto excluding them to the access to contact-tracing
apps.[^419] In Italy, the national contact tracing app doesn't run on an
array of older Android and Apple phones (and has shown some bugs also
with more recents models), making income and consumer electronics
competence as decisive factors in the spread of the app among the
Italian population. The predominance of older versions of smartphones in
Italy has been indicated as a driver of the low adoption of the app, as
Wired reports.[^420] Although the Bangladesh and Western stories can't
be put on the same level in regards of their severity, it is clear that
at every latitude technological determinism, when pushed with too much
sublime emphasis on "smart" and "shiny" digital technologies, may in any
case lead to forms of inequality and exclusion. Furthermore, evidence
about the effectiveness of contact tracing apps is also limited, as
reported by Lancet in August.[^421]

### Surveillance {#surveillance .BOOK_Heading-3}

Whereas much of the debate about privacy in the context of the COVID-19
pandemic was about contact tracing apps, they're certainly not the only
potentially harmful technology revitalized in recent months.
Surveillance studies scholars Martin French and Torin Monahan have
pointed out that there is "evidence of surveillance dynamics at play
with how bodies and pathogens are being measured, tracked, predicted,
and regulated."[^422] Basically, controlling a pandemic spread involves
forms of surveillance. The spread of the pandemic has seen an
acceleration in the adoption of various monitoring technologies and
automated decision-making systems, according to an AlgorithmWatch
report.[^423] These technologies include bracelets, selfies-apps,
thermal scanners, facial recognition systemsm and programs for digital
data collection and analysis. As AlgorithWatch posits, are these
technologies becoming the "new normal?" The pandemic has seen an
acceleration of the implementation of these technologies, frequently
supported by a deterministic approach, raising critical questions about
informed consent and the impact of such technologies on our fundamental
rights. As we wrote at the beginning of this essay, global emergencies
are also stress tests for societies and democracies at large, since
they're forced to cope with extraordinary situations. As Elise Racine, a
research associate at A Path for Europe (PfEU), argues, "risk for
function creep means that these tools may be co-opted by other security
initiatives."[^424] In this way, data-driven technologies may endanger
the fundamental rights of the most vulnerable, who are more exposed to
abusive forms of monitoring and surveillance.

The pandemic has revitalized the appetite for surveillance all around
the world, with facial recognition and other controversial technologies
leading the way. As the Centre for Security Studies at ETH Zürich
reports, the market for surveillance cameras is expecting a substantial
growth in 2021, reaching 300,000 new cameras being installed every day
globally and a billion cameras installed by the end of the same
year.[^425] Democratic institutions are at stake, since intrusive
technologies undermine democratic values and have been shown to be
disproportionately used to target minorities and exacerbate racial
biases.[^426]

Examples of facial recognition being used to enforce COVID-19
restrictions have already emerged from Russia, where Moscow's enormous
network of cameras has been used to control residents during the
lockdown.[^427] Even in democratic contexts like Italy, facial
recognition is making its way into public spaces, often pushed as
migration-containment strategy, as happened in the Italian city of
Como[^428]---another sign that the most vulnerable communities of our
societies are also the most exposed to constant monitoring. Crises set
new standards. Are we slowly moving into a surveillance state where
immediate health measures are paving the way for overreaching forms of
surveillance that are here to stay? Without proper testing, clear
frameworks, and guidelines, we risk endorsing a normalization of
surveillance with effects that could be difficult to assess and take
years to be de-implemented.

### Borders {#borders .BOOK_Heading-3}

Borders have traditionally been surveilled. Unsurprisingly, technologies
for monitoring borders are also accelerating their adoption across the
world, riding promises to make life easier and safer during the
pandemic. Whereas boarding a plane without touching any surface may
sound like a viable solution to prevent the further spread of the virus,
boarding a plane only through facial recognition raises obvious privacy
concerns. Datafied "immunity passports" now being discussed in various
countries pose serious threats to various segments of the population.
They have been sold as another "crisis-response that depends on
technology, as we saw with contact-tracing apps," writes Privacy
International.[^429] As the London-based NGO argues, these technical
solutions are currently being hyped and pushed by private actors
involved in travelling and border services, but their adoption may have
serious impacts on the right of citizens to movement, and the lives of
those most discriminated against. Also, these tools may become useful
for profiling, as they may give "the police and security services more
powers to not only know information about our health, but also to stop
people and demand proof of immunity in certain situations," as Privacy
International again argues. The global lockdown has also deeply changed
the nature or geographical borders and their political meanings, as
migrants have been disproportionately victimized by this new status quo.
Frequently, migrants and refugees failed to be included in COVID-19
statistics and figures, given their invisibility.[^430] Refugees are
usually the first targets of the datafied surveillance practices
discussed here. In April, the Bureau of Investigative Journalism
reported how the digital monitoring and surveillance technological
practices being now adopted during the pandemic were originally tested
on refugees and migrants during the 2015 migration crisis in
Europe.[^431] In Singapore, migrant workers have been forced to download
a contact-tracing app[^432], while Russia is reportedly considering
following suit.[^433] Vulnerable communities, like migrants on the move,
who are already suffering from weaker safeguards for their rights and
freedoms, are now also increasingly becoming a testing ground for
implementing datafied monitoring practices that may end up becoming
standardized practices in a post-pandemic world.

### Infrastructures {#infrastructures .BOOK_Heading-3}

Digital infrastructures and platforms gained new centrality in our daily
lives because of the pandemic. Smartworking, remote teaching, and public
services were forced to migrate online and still rely on digital tools
to function. This evolution also has profound implications in a society
pushing for more datafication. It is time to ask, what are the long-term
implications of making private services the de facto infrastructure of
social life, citizenship, and agency? Coming back to contact-tracing
apps as an example, there is little doubt that the framework provided by
the Apple-Google alliance made a privacy-respectful structure readily
available. Yet, we should demand greater transparency when such powerful
companies become official suppliers of digital infrastructures used for
health services. Power balances between national states and private
entities are at stake. Most urgently, as David Lyon urges, the pandemic
should be the moment when we start considering surveillance implications
beyond the singular privacy issue.[^434] More is at stake, because
surveillance has become a structural element of today's societies. With
most of our lives moving online, we're also moving into spaces where
what Shoshana Zuboff calls "surveillance capitalism" is the ruling
economical, political, and social structure.[^435] Surveillance
capitalism is increasingly exposing all societies' activities to
extended datafatication: the constant monitoring, sorting, and profiling
of people for profit. It is time to build exit strategies and new forms
of resistance; the datafied society is now an established reality and is
already affected by global issues such as a pandemic. The view from
inside this crisis has indicated that, in its current shape, the
datafied society is increasingly working against its own citizens.

## COVID-19 and the Stripping of Power from the Edges (Niels ten Oever) {#covid-19-and-the-stripping-of-power-from-the-edges-niels-ten-oever .BOOK_Heading-2}

At the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, people wondered whether the
internet infrastructure would be capable of handling the increase in
data traffic. When many people started working, streaming, and following
the rapidly unfolding news on social media from home, many expected this
would strain on the internet infrastructure. Some European politicians
were so concerned that they called on Netflix to lower the resolution of
their video streams.[^436] Why did it turn out the internet
infrastructure was able to cope with the increasing demand? The answer
is, because the internet no longer works as most people think it does.
An extra layer of control was added to the internet by Content Delivery
Networks. This chapter will discuss how pressure on the infrastructural
margins of the internet is strengthening the center of the network, and
examine how COVID-19 has exacerbated this trend.

In 2011, the Tunisian government started heavily censoring the internet
in response to popular uprisings in the country. In response, many
internet users engaged in what is commonly called a Distributed Denial
of Service (DDoS) attack on the Tunisian government\'s website. In a
DDoS attack, hundreds or even thousands of computers try to reach a
website at the same time. This can lead to the website\'s server, or the
connection to the server, being overloaded and thus render the website
unavailable to internet users. When a website suddenly becomes very
popular, this can also lead to similar behavior. When many users try to
connect at the same time, the traffic effectively renders the site or
service unavailable. Eight of Tunisia's websites were forced offline.

In response to the DDoS attacks, and to prevent down-time of servers due
to their popularity, Content Distribution Networks (CDNs) were
increasingly used. CDNs are globally-distributed proxy servers, often
placed in data centers close to internet eXchange Points (IXPs). While a
user thinks they are connecting to a popular website far away, they are
connecting to a CDN server that is located near them. While you are
thinking you are streaming a video from a jurisdiction that you think is
safe, the video is more likely to be stored close to the network
controlled by your Internet Service Provider (ISP) or your
telecommunications operator.

When the internet was designed, an engineer adopted the end-to-end
principles as their central motto. This was included in the mission
statement of the Internet Engineering Taskforce, the institution
responsible for co-developing and standardizing the internet
infrastructure:

The Internet isn\'t value-neutral, and neither is the IETF. We want the
Internet to be useful for communities that share our commitment to
openness and fairness. We embrace technical concepts such as
decentralized control, edge-user empowerment and sharing of resources,
because those concepts resonate with the core values of the IETF
community. These concepts have little to do with the technology that\'s
possible, and much to do with the technology that we choose to create
(RFC3935).[^437]

When users connected to the internet during the COVID-19 pandemic, it
may seem they were edge-users connecting to another endpoint over "dumb
pipes"---leveraging the powers of decentralized control. The truth it
quite the opposite. The internet infrastructure held up during the
COVID-19 pandemic not because people were getting their content from the
global internet, but from a data center near them. You may think is
actually a good thing, since it caused the internet to not collapse?
Maybe. CDNs are the mere latest cause and consequence of centralization
on the internet. The difference between CDNs and other large players
such as Google and Facebook (who have their own CDNs) is that these
other CDNs remain largely invisible. Some of you might have heard about
Cloudflare, but what about Akamai, Fastly, and Limelight?

In 2017, Cloudflare unilaterally removed the neo-nazi forum and website
Daily Stormer from its services.[^438] In 2019, it similarly removed the
imageboard 8chan after two shootings in the United States. The company
cited the following reason for removal: "In the case of the El Paso
shooting, the suspected terrorist gunman appears to have been inspired
by the forum website known as 8chan. Based on evidence we\'ve seen, it
appears that he posted a screed to the site immediately before beginning
his terrifying attack on the El Paso Walmart killing 20 people".[^439]
The interesting point was that no one asked Cloudflare to do this; they
removed the content on their own volition, without a clear process in
place. Many critical internet scholars such as Suzanne van Geuns,
Corinne Cath,[^440] and Kate Klonick[^441] have reported on this. While
such decisions show the concrete impact these companies can have, it is
perhaps even more telling that one hears very little about these
companies.

CDNs are perhaps the internet infrastructure that companies benefitted
most from during the COVID-19 epidemic, because there was increased
traffic to the websites that they provide services to. But what about
the people who requested information from these websites? Technically,
they got served by another server than the one they thought they were
connected to. They might have received something else than what they
asked for, because CDNs allow for particularly fine-mazed
geography-based adaptation of content. The CDN that served a user in
Senegal might have different data than a CDN that served a user in
Brisbane. And there is almost no way of knowing by which particular CDN
server you got served, or to bypass the CDN. In this way, the opacity of
internet infrastructure was exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. In
other words, the COVID-19 pandemic led to further black-boxing of the
internet infrastructure, making it harder for users to understand how it
works. While this might make the internet faster and more available, it
does not make the internet more reliable. Arguably, it makes the
internet a better tool for control, because it increases power
asymmetries between users and transnational corporations.

In 2011, Tunisian internet users were able to use the internet
infrastructure against their own government. In 2020, it is nearly
impossible for users around the world to even know where the websites
they are accessing are located, let alone take them down. The internet
is no longer a bazaar. The COVID-19 pandemic helped fortify an
industrial zone that now is the internet, which only allows users to
connect on the outside, without having a view or control on the inside.
The internet has become a smart network, with not so smart edges.

Despite the evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic in Russia, a state of
emergency has not been declared in the country; only specific regions
have entered into a state of "high alert" since early April. "Compulsory
holidays" are only partially respected by a population plunged into a
growing vagueness that is health-related, legal and economic at
once.[^442] In this context, Russia is deploying and updating its
digital strategy and infrastructure, which have been carefully
scrutinized in recent years for centralizing authority. What does the
COVID-19 crisis say about the Russian state's digital power, and the
challenges it poses to public freedoms?

### The Russian State Facing COVID-19: Digital Ambitions put to the Test {#the-russian-state-facing-covid-19-digital-ambitions-put-to-the-test .BOOK_Heading-3}

The Russian authorities have advocated the use of digital tools to
control the movements of citizens and limit the circulation of the
virus. These uses aimed at "securitization" are inspired by China,
Korea, and Singapore, but are also part of the "sovereignty" logic of
the Russian Internet (Runet). The Russian Internet was already
engaged[^443] before the start of the epidemic, consolidating
surveillance systems whose existence dates back several years (e.g.,
video surveillance cameras, aggregation of geolocation data supplied to
the authorities by mobile operators).[^444]

As of February, Sergei Sobyanin, the mayor of Moscow, proposed using
facial recognition to monitor people returning from abroad, using the
surveillance cameras of the "Safe City" program, operating since
2018.[^445] Between February and March, 200 people who broke their
quarantine were identified, including a man who merely took out his
trash. As a study by IT and SORM---a popular blog on Telegram devoted to
Runet surveillance and regulation issues---shows, this device was a
catalyst for inequality.[^446] Surveillance cameras were mainly
installed in the modest districts of Moscow because those who decided
their location resided in the upscale districts, and did not wish their
activities to be monitored.

On March 20, 2020, faced with an increase in contaminations, Prime
Minister Mikhail Mishustin recommended[^447] monitoring citizens who
have been in contact with infected people by collecting geolocation data
from operators, and transmitting them to local administrations.[^448] A
patient monitoring application "Social Monitoring" was made available on
April 1, 2020 on GooglePlay. It quickly became controversial, since its
surveillance goes far beyond the movement of patients and offers little
protection of personal data. The application was later finally
withdrawn.[^449]

However, the Russian State has not abandoned the digital tracking of
citizens. Since April 13, all trips within Moscow that involved public
transportation were carried out under penalty of fines, without a
digital pass generated on an official website.[^450] In response to
criticism of the "Social Monitoring" application, the Moscow
municipality declared that with this new device, personal data will be
stored in Russian territory and will be deleted when the "high alert"
state is over.[^451] The same system was active in Tatarstan and the
Primorye region; QR-Code passes were also available and recommended but
not mandatory in Nizhny-Novgorod, while other Russian regions resorted
to lighter measures.[^452]

### Resistance and Mobilisations of the Free Internet {#resistance-and-mobilisations-of-the-free-internet .BOOK_Heading-3}

The use of digital data to strengthen surveillance of the population
while coping with the disease is causing concern for defenders of online
freedoms. Technologists, engineers, and developers discuss government
projects and conduct independent investigations to uncover security
vulnerabilities, technical issues, and other controversial aspects of
the technologies deployed by the Russian state.

Several associations and independent media channels have alerted
internet users to the growing attacks on the protection of personal data
and the development of online surveillance. On March 27, the NGO
Roskomsvoboda published
a[vademecum](https://cards.roskomsvoboda.org/card/digitalrights/) on
digital rights in a pandemic period, stressing that the use of personal
data, especially biometric data, legally required the consent of
individuals. But "the use of facial recognition is in a gray area,"
argues lawyer Sarkis Darbinyan.[^453] The association is also launching,
with other associations in the post-Soviet space, an inventory of
restrictions on digital freedoms around the world.[^454] The Agora
association is opening a legal aid service linked to the pandemic. Its
lawyers are also concerned about the use of facial recognition to
enforce quarantine.[^455] Activists close to government-opposing
personality Alexei Navalny (Society for the Protection of
Internet)[^456] denounced, even more boldly, the establishment of a
"digital gulag",[^457] and called on citizens not to transmit their
personal data to the applications that control movements and trace
contacts.

At the same time, solidarity initiatives are developing on the internet,
aimed at supporting the poorest citizens and caregivers. The Makers vs.
Covid collective uses 3D-printing techniques to provide doctors with the
protective gear they need.[^458] An online hackathon, "Covidhack," is
developing a bot for Telegram that produces a citizen database allowing
people with coronavirus to speak anonymously and map their symptoms.
Internet infrastructures are also being weakened by the pandemic, due to
the growth in traffic driven by new digital habits in confinement.
Russian networks are frequently down, but the maintanance of technicians
and cable operators employed by the over three thousand Internet Service
Providers (ISPs) that manage these networks comes at the risk of legal
threats. OrderKom, a consulting firm for ISPs, offers these workers
legal support, including the preparation of authorizations for movements
due to on-site work, and a legal defense in the event of a fine.[^459]

##  {#section-24 .BOOK_Heading-2}

### Faults and Paradoxes of Digital Surveillance {#faults-and-paradoxes-of-digital-surveillance .BOOK_Heading-3}

Over the days and the weeks, gaps emerged between the authorities'
security ambitions and the realities of their implementation. Digital
surveillance and health-related solutions were delegated to many public
and private, federal and regional players, who often made contradictory
decisions. The paradoxes and dysfunctions documented by online freedom
activists show the limits of the announced "securitization" design.
Perhaps the most obvious failure is that of digital passes in Moscow.
The Nedoma.mos.ru site that generates the passes uses foreign hosting
servers; the government was therefore accused of putting its own project
of sovereign Runet in jeopardy.[^460]

Digital freedom activists, such as Mikhail Klimarev of the Society for
the Protection of the Internet, point to the ineffectiveness of
technological solutions. Instead, he suggests that COVID-19 strategies
should focus on civic responsibility, while digital surveillance
infantilizes citizens and is likely to be circumvented. This crisis
highlights the lack of mutual trust between citizens and the state.
Indeed, the information on the epidemic disseminated by the state is
viewed with suspicion, oscillating between "they are hiding the true
extent of the disaster to us" and "it is a plot to muzzle us even more."
If the authorities take the COVID-19 crisis as an opportunity to re-open
their hunt for "fake news," on their end, YouTubers and independent
journalists denounce the incomplete or questionable information
disseminated by representatives of power. They also object to the public
behaviour of officials like Vladimir Putin's spokesperson, who showed up
at a press conference with a highly contested "virus blocker"
badge.[^461] Sometimes, events are borderline ironic, such as the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs' opening of a thread of information for its
nationals abroad on the Telegram application, which is officially banned
in Russia.

Thus, part of civil society, without questioning the need for
confinement, mobilizes against the threatening initiatives of the
Russian "Big Brother." It denounces the incompetence of the authorities
to manage the implementation of technical devices, as well as the
institutional power's violation of its own laws (like the provision on
the storage of Russian data on Russian territory), as well as the
non-protection of personal data.

While the wide and ambitious Russian Internet surveillance and
sovereignty project is gaining strength during the coronavirus crisis,
its implementation is uncertain and often contradictory. The pandemic
demonstrates the limits of the internet infrastructure centralization
project. The government ends up being obliged to relax specific
regulatory measures, such as the Yarovaya law, which requires ISPs to
keep the history and metadata of users for the purpose of legal
interception and fight against terrorism.[^462] However, this apparent
complexity is not necessarily synonymous with ineffectiveness. It is
part of the flexible reconfigurations of digital constraints in Russia,
adjusting to the recently rising challenges, and raising legitmate
concerns of digital freedoms defenders.

## Alternative Perspectives on Relationality, People and Technology During a Pandemic: Zenzeleni Networks in South Africa (Nic Bidwell & Sol Luca de Tena) {#alternative-perspectives-on-relationality-people-and-technology-during-a-pandemic-zenzeleni-networks-in-south-africa-nic-bidwell-sol-luca-de-tena .BOOK_Heading-2}

Many rural communities in Africa have characteristics that are neither
represented by data about COVID-19, nor addressed by public health
information designed to help people protect themselves. This does not
mean to say that rural inhabitants are unaffected by information
designed for different populations; and grassroots initiatives have been
vital in countering the impacts of this. Here, we reflect on the role of
community networks in customising information and services for rural
inhabitants during the pandemic, and how they reveal constructs embedded
in data representation and aggregation. Community networks (CNs) are
telecommunications initiatives that are installed, maintained, and
operated by local inhabitants to meet their own communication needs.
Rey-Moreno's 2017 survey identified 37 community networks in 12 African
countries.[^463] With the success of four Annual African CN
Summits[^464], more are emerging every year. Our account focuses on
Zenzeleni Networks in South Africa. Thus, we begin by introducing its
response to COVID-19 and ensuring health information suited local
circumstances. We end by arguing that examples of contextualisation
reveal logics about personhood that are vital to tackling the disease,
but not represented by individualist models embedded in datafication.

### Zenzeleni's Response to COVID-19 {#zenzelenis-response-to-covid-19 .BOOK_Heading-3}

Zenzeleni is a community-owned wireless internet service provider that
has connected more than 13,000 people and 10 organisations to the
internet in South Africa's Eastern Cape province.[^465] The network is
owned by amaXhosa inhabitants (including 40% women) and is run by two
local cooperatives. A cooperative approach ensures internet access costs
are up to 20 times lower than services offered by existing
telecommunications operators, and expenditure is retained locally. The
non-profit organisation Zenzeleni Networks NPC was established through
the cooperative, and provides vital connections with regulatory
authorities and telecommunications expertise. Zenzeleni was seeded in
Mankosi, a remote district of 12 villages, by PhD researchers at the
University of the Western Cape in Cape Town,[^466] which followed
prolonged collaborations on solar electricity and media sharing
technologies.[^467] Over the past eight years, the community network has
evolved as a social innovation ecosystem in which rural communities own
their telecommunication businesses. Like other community networks[^468]
in the global south,[^469] Zenzeleni has created employment and
developed technical skills in one the most disadvantaged areas in South
Africa.

As well as providing more affordable and higher quality network services
than alternatives, Zenzeleni's embeddedness directly links technology
and media considerations to local life. As the COVID-19 lockdown ensued,
inhabitants working, studying or seeking work in cities returned to
their rural family homes. Zenzeleni played a vital role in providing
continuity to residents' urban lives, by adding network infrastructure
to extend the community access points and ensuring free and open access
to education websites, including all of the nation's universities and
further education colleges. Indeed, usage of access points tripled
during since the pandemic began.

Not only are health services difficult to access, but the local
populations served by Zenzeleni are particularly vulnerable; they have a
high incidence of HIV, tuberculosis, and child and maternal health
issues.[^470] Thus, Zenzeleni sourced funding to connect the District
Hospital. Just as importantly, however, from the pandemic's onset, the
network started to address health information needs. Like other groups
across Africa, Zenzeleni immediately recognised the mismatch between
health information issued by WHO and South Africa's national government
and local circumstances. Not only was information initially unavailable
in most of Africa's 2000 languages, even when advice was in a home
language it was ill-suited to many rural contexts. Recommending regular
handwashing, for instance, is inappropriate for Mankosi's inhabitants
who share a few unreliable taps in their villages because water is not
supplied to households. Similarly, guidelines on shared transport are
irrelevant when only one bus a day connects villages on a five hour
round trip to the nearest supermarket. Zenzeleni ensured free and open
access to official health websites. Understanding the local context
launched projects also increased access to relevant information
resources and raised awareness of health strategies that matched local
circumstances.

### *My Mask Protects you, and Yours Protects me*: Accounting for Personhood in the Datafied Society {#my-mask-protects-you-and-yours-protects-me-accounting-for-personhood-in-the-datafied-society .BOOK_Heading-3}

While providing health information in home languages suited to local
constraints is vital, but efficacy in managing a socially-spread disease
requires integrating deeper insights about the nuances of local social
practices and relations. For instance, people returning to villages from
cities bring information of varying legitimacy, from recommendations to
outright falsehoods. Locally, this information was interpreted through
assumptions that information in cities was inherently more credible
because cities are highly connected. The valorisation of information
associated with electronic media has been discussed elsewhere in rural
southern Africa.[^471] An implicit part of Zenzeleni's role has been to
foster critical approaches to disinformation by directing inhabitants to
legitimate information and ensuring information was properly
contextualised. However, at the same time, promoting information access
must account for sharing practices. While internet hotspots safely offer
socially-distanced access, many inhabitants group around tablets and
phones.[^472]

Device-sharing practices in Mankosi are not merely about limited access
to devices. They also involve a cultural construct of relationality.
Devices like smartphones are embedded with logic that personhood exists
prior to interpersonal relationships (Bidwell, 2016). This individualist
logic contrasts with the philosophy of Ubuntu, an isiXhosa word which is
often translated as \"I am because we." This collective logic assumes
that neither community or individual exists prior, and being human
depends on the mutual and dynamic constitution of other humans. As Eze
explains:

We create each other and need to sustain this otherness creation. And if
we belong to each other, we participate in our creations: we are because
you are, and since you are, definitely I am.[^473]

The importance of the construct of Ubuntu to effective contextualisation
is illustrated by Zenzeleni's local volunteers' observations that
community members assisted each other in putting on face-masks. Senses
of mutual responsibility are straightforward in communities such as
Mankosi. However, routinely performing responsibility involves physical
help and, since none of the guidelines explicitly combine social
distancing with putting on a mask, this represents an ambiguity.

The challenge of translating a guideline such as "wear it for me"
reveals an important role for community networks in COVID-19 times, and
in datafication more generally. Much like the assumption of a person
putting on their masks themselves, prevalent models of data extraction,
representation, and personalisation cultivate and amplify an
individualist logic.[^474] Yet, as many commentators have suggested, the
best protection we have against the virus is Ubuntu.[^475] Zenzeleni and
other community networks around the world offer an alternative
perspective on relationality, people, and technology.

***Platform Imperialism in the Time of the Pandemic: The Role of YouTube
Users in the Analysis of Content Moderation in "Other" Idioms***

*How can users actively intervene to mitigate the consequences of
platform imperialism in the time of the pandemic? This chapter takes
YouTube as an object of investigation to show how users can actively
partake in an empirical analysis aimed at identifying the mechanisms of
content personalization with respect to COVID-19-related content in
languages other than English, namely Spanish, Portuguese, Chinese and
Arabic. The essay is based on original data from an experiment conducted
during the COVID-19 pandemic by means of the Tracking Exposed software.*

Questo capitolo discute le premesse di quella che qui identifichiamo
come una situazione di sudditanza verso un sistema di piattaforme
digitali che agiscono come controllori del mondo dell\'informazione.
L'articolo utilizza YouTube come oggetto d\'indagine, identificando una
logica che vede nell'algoritmo un capro espiatorio grazie al quale le
piattaforme possono proclamarsi immuni da ogni errore. La discussione
qui proposta offre un'illustrazione del funzionamento dell'algoritmo di
YouTube, proponendo una logica che renda il lettore consapevole del
funzionamento del capitalismo di sorveglianza e quindi capace di
sovvertirlo.[^476]

**La Moderazione dei Contenuti come Forma di Colonialismo Culturale**

Oggigiorno, la visione di Internet come forza democratica può sembrare
un ricordo utopico e distante. Qui ripercorriamo alcuni passaggi chiave
che hanno trasformato la rete globale dello scambio di conoscenza in un
sistema di sfruttamento cognitivo degli utenti stessi.

I sistemi che intermediano l\'accesso all\'informazione (pensate a
Google, YouTube, Facebook e le maggiori piattaforme digitali) hanno
agito, in un primo periodo della loro esistenza, come un territorio
libero ed inesplorato. Connetersi e scambiarsi informazioni era
possibile per chiunque avesse accesso alla rete. Quasi non era prevista
l\'ipotesi che gli scambi d\'informazione potessero essere problematici
dal punto di vista personale e collettivo, complici anche i cambiamenti
politici di allora in alcuni casi difficili da pensare senza il
contributo dei *social network* (per esempio l'elezione di Barack Obama
a presidente deli Stati Uniti d'America nel 2008) o raccontati dalla
stampa occidentale come esempi dell'impatto positivo dei social network,
come la cosidetta "Primavera Araba".

Lo scorso secolo anticipava l'idea che Internet sarebbe stato il futuro.
Iniziò allora un massiccio investimento da parte di interessi privati,
tralasciando l'importante concetto che il web non consiste in una serie
di siti e servizi disconnessi tra loro (facebook.com o twitter.com), ma
in una rete di reti. La romanzata versione di una "rete delle reti"
decentralizzata, multiculturale e resiliente, è stata superata
dall\'esistenza di piattaforme che fornivano nuove, unique funzionalità
agli utenti ma anche possibilità alle istituzioni pre-Internet. Questi
sviluppi sono stati funzionali ad una specie di "gioco delle
piattaforme"--- infrastrutture "nuove" che mettono in contatto la
domanda e l\'offerta.

In qualitá di territorio ancora inesplorato e mercato non regolamentato,
Internet ha avvantaggiato gli attori con più risorse a disposizione e
quelli più tecnologicamente avanzati, attribuendo loro il potere di
manipolare la circolazione di informazioni dopo che per anni questa è
stata organica e non censurabile. Si può dire che il campo di battaglia
siamo noi, utenti anonimi aggregati nell\'ordine delle centinaia di
migliai. Il valore economico della rete si misura nei nostri minuti di
attenzione.

Sono nati così mercati accessori, come quelli che permettono di comprare
visibilità tramite i cosidetti *influencers*, organizzare eserciti di
*troll* (disturbatori) a pochi centesimi al post, o condurre vaste
operazioni di *scraping* (la raccolta dei dati automatizzata) per creare
disinformazione mirata. Alcune di queste operazioni sono salite agli
onori delle cronache grazie a casi eclatanti come quello di *Cambridge
Analytica*. Altre sono emerse da casi meno clamorosi e visibili, ma
contribuiscono tutt\'ora alla crescita di contenuti manipolatori
(disinformazione), tossici (incitazioni all\'odio), criminali
(reclutamento terroristico, discorsi divisivi ed avversi ai diritti
umani), e non sollecitati (spam organizzato meccanicamente). Questo ha
reso la vita sulle piattaforme sociali frustrante e problematica. E la
pandemia da COVID-19 non ha fatto che peggiorare le cose per gli utenti.
È in questo contesto storico che si inscrive l'analisi dell'algoritmo di
YouTube presentata qui.

### L'Antefatto: Come Analizzare l\'Algoritmo di YouTube {#lantefatto-come-analizzare-lalgoritmo-di-youtube .BOOK_Heading-3}

Dal 2016 sviluppo un sistema di analisi degli algoritmi chiamato
Tracking Exposed.[^477] Il sistema usa software libero e rende le
metodologie di analisi ripetibili. Ogni utente può usarlo per condurre
analisi, ogni gruppo di ricercatrici può verificare come i contenuti
vengono regionalizzati e decidere se l\'algoritmo li stia trattanto in
modo appropriato.

Il nostro lavoro di analisi è iniziato con Facebook, per poi proseguire
con YouTube, PornHub e Amazon. Il concetto è lo stesso per ogni
piattaforma: creare e tenere copia di quello che gli algoritmi di
personalizzazione producono sulla base dei dati dell'utente. Ottenuti i
dati, se ne possono fare tre macrousi: 1) ottenere prove più sostanziali
di un aneddoto circa la personalizzazione dei contenuti sulle
piattaforme per mezzo degli algoritmi, 2) comparare la propria
personalizzazione con quella di altri utenti, per testare quanto
distorta stia diventando la nostra percezione, 3) analizzare
l\'algoritmo e il suo comportamento testando diverse condizioni d\'uso.

Va chiarito che non si tratta di *reverse engineering* degli algoritmi
di personalizzazione. Le aziende in questione monitorano ogni sensore di
un cellulare, i nostri contatti, le loro attività, e le "sommano" ai
dati del passato, generando troppe variabili che sfuggono alla nostra
visione individuale. Non ci dobbiamo comunque perdere d\'animo: iniziare
a vedere e misurare l\'ingerenza della personalizzazione rappresenta già
un primo passo verso un'approccio critico e comsapevole verso gli
algoritmi e le piattaforme.

Nell' estate 2019, il software YTTREX (abbreviazione del nome esteso,
che poi è anche il sito: https://youtube.tracking.exposed) era pronto
per essere sperimentato da dieci studentesse presso l\'Università di
Amsterdam. Va ricordato che una piattaforma può personalizzare se
conosce qualcosa di noi, se invece il soggetto si pone come nuovo
utente, con un browser \"pulito\" si può osservare come la piattaforma
ci tratti nel modo più generico possibile sebbene entro una macro
categoria al di fuori del nostro controllo. In quel caso, l\'essere
connessi alla rete universitaria rappresentava una variabile nuova e
ignota: se il test fosse stato realizzato usando una rete wifi libera
vicino alla stazione ferroviaria, o al Politecnico di Milano, la nostra
prima esplorazione dell\'algortimo sarebbe molto probabilmente stata
diversa. Fortunatamente ai fini dell\'esperimento è sufficiente operare
tra una massima personalizzazione ed una minima, e non serve aumentare
la complessità tenendo sotto controllo tutte le variabili possibili.

Una delle prime operazioni da fare consiste in "pulire" il browser, il
che consiste in diverse opzioni di rimozione dei dati presenti nella
*cache*, dei *cookie* e altri elementi. Se ci fosse un tasto
\"nuclearizza tutte le tracce\", in grado di pulire gli innumerevoli
traccianti nascosti nel browser con un solo click, molti sicuramente lo
userebbero. Navigare è un\'esperienza che non per forza deve essere
registrata ed associata ad una storia indelebile: si tratta di una
questione complessa associata alla privacy, ma ha un impatto notevole
sulla libertà di essere informati in modo non discriminatorio. Comunque,
questo tasto non c\'è---del resto il leader di mercato dei browser,
Chrome, è sviluppato dal leader del tracciamento, Google. Per pulire il
browser occorre un'azione coordinata: almeno quattro click più alcune
accortezze di cui essere a conoscenza. Per semplicità, all'inizio del
progetto installammo un browser relativamente poco conosciuto, Brave,
per iniziare gli esperimenti in una condizione di "zero tracciamento".

Ci interessava documentare se, e quanto, i profili sotto osservazione
ricevessero le stesse "raccomandazioni" in termini di contenuto. Stavamo
considerato i primi venti video correlati, ed abbiamo scelto una
visualizzazione a grafo. La figura 1 mostra i dieci profili in
questione: al centro sono rappresentati con i cerchi, i video suggeriti
ad almeno due profili. Più grandi le dimensioni del cerchio, più volte
il contenuto in questione è stato suggerito agli utenti: lo si può
capire anche dalla quantità di linee che lo collegano ai profili. I
pallini verso l\'esterno invece rappresentano video suggeriti solo ad un
profilo in modo esclusivo: questa è la porzione personalizzata dei
contenuti.

![](media/image5.png){width="6.268055555555556in"
height="5.372916666666667in"}Fig. 1. Risultato dell'analisi con browser
"ripuliti".[^478]

Emergono due osservazioni significative. La prima è che la stragrande
maggioranza dei video è comune a tutti i profili sotto osservazione,
mentre la seconda è che alcuni profili hanno subito un minimo di
personalizzazione nonostante la mancanza di traccianti pregressi e di
qualunque memoria digitale. Dobbiamo prendere in considerazione il
fattow che non può esistere un modo veramente neutrale di visitare
YouTube: la piattaforma infatti sembra prendere in considerazione due
variabili iniziali, ovvero la nazione di provenienza dell'utente e la
lingua configurata nel sistema operativo. I profili 3, 4 ed 8 nel nostro
esperimento erano di tre studentesse che, come abbiamo scoperto in
seguito, avevano il computer configurato rispettivamente in coreano e
francese come lingue di sistema, mentre le altre macchine erano
configurate per l'inglese. Il video osservato era in lingua inglese, ed
il collegamento partiva da una rete olandese. È un comportamento che
abbiamo giustificato immaginando una persona che si trova in un paese
straniero, che accede ad un link su YouTube da un browser appena
installato (Brave). YouTube non sa se questa persona conosca l\'inglese
o l\'olandese in quanto la lingua di sistema viene comunicata
automaticamente dal browser al fine di offrire un aggancio ad una realtà
comprensibile all'utente. Sulla base di questo esperimento, possiamo
concludere con una discreta certezza che alcune raccomandazioni degli
algoritmi sono personalizzate sulla base di base di dati tecnici e non
comportamentali.

Per concludere, i video suggeriti, la grande maggioranza in comune,
erano tutti afferenti all\'argomento del video osservato. A quel punto
abbiamo ripetuto l\'esperimento, ma utilizzando i browser di uso
quotidiano da parte delle studentesse usavano, quindi "inquinato" da
innumerevoli traccianti web come ogni dispositivo non adeguatamente
pulito con cura.

Fig. 2 Risultato dell'analisi con brower "personalizzati".

Ci è parso immediatamente chiaro quanto la personalizzazione fosse la
giustificazione per le percezioni divergenti. I video in comune sono una
minoranza. Questa condizione è quella standard nella quale si trovano le
utenti di YouTube. Analizzando i risultati della personalizzazione del
contenuto, abbiamo potuto notare come in una certa percentuale la
personalizzazione sia il risultato di abitudini personali, ma
specialmente come dipendano direttamente dall'interpretazione autonoma
di YouTube che cerca di collegare le tendenze individuali al video
oggetto di studio, che era lo stesso, visualizzato nello stesso momento
e a partire da uno medesimo luogo fisico.

### La Personalizzazione dei Contenuti Durante la Pandemia: Il Test Collettivo {#la-personalizzazione-dei-contenuti-durante-la-pandemia-il-test-collettivo .BOOK_Heading-3}

All'inizio della pandemia, YouTube ha dichiarato al New York Times che
avrebbe rimosso eventuali copntenuti vergenti su teorie del complotto
relative al coronavirus dalla piattaforma.[^479] Il nostro team ha
ipotizzato che l'azione della piattaforma si sarebbe concentrata sui
contenuti in lingua inglese, sapendo che l\'algoritmo tende a trovare
suggerimenti personalizzati sulla base di logiche poco chiare che
collegano le azioni passate deglim utenti al tema del video osservato.
Se quindi dei video contenenti disinformazione sul COVID-19 fossero
rimasti disponibili su YouTube, ma fossero stati, ad esempio, in
spagnolo, questi non sarebbero stati fatti oggetto della rimozione.

Per confermare questa ipotesi avevamo però bisogno di coinvolgere una
certa quantità di utenti di accedere a video che parlassero di COVID-19
e della pandemia in generale. I video dovevano essere gli stessi, per
rendere i dati comparabili riducendo le variabili sotto osservazione.
Dovevamo raccogliere evidenze di come \"gli altri idiomi\" ricevessero
un diverso trattamento rispetto all\'inglese, e per questo abbiamo preso
in considerazione le quattro lingue più parlate al mondo oltre
all'inglese: spagnolo, portoghese, cinese ed arabo. Il video di partenza
doveva provenire da una fonte autorevole, e per fortuna la BBC trasmette
in tutte e cinque le lingue di cui avevamo bisogno. Un video che
spiegava il virus COVID-19, pubblicato pressochè negli stessi giorni sui
diversi canali della BBC, ha fatto al caso nostro. Abbiamo pertanto
lanciato una *call to action* per reclutare volontarie per il nostro
esperimento.

Ogni volontaria avrebbe dovuto installare l\'estensione sul browser,
accedere in sequenza ai cinque video, così da poter poi studiare le
raccomandazioni che YouTube avrebbere presentato agli utenti tra il 25
ed il 26 marzo 2020, in modo da generare una "fotografia" unica e
irripetibile che ci avrebbe permetto di poter effettivamente contestare
le dichiarazioni di YouTube.[^480]

I risultati[^481], dettagliati nell\'articolo intitolato \"YTTREX:
crowdsourced analysis of YouTube\'s recommender system during COVID-19
pandemic\", a firma di Leonardo Sanna, Salvatore Romano, Giulia Corona e
Claudio Agosti.[^482] L'articolo presenta l\'analisi quantitativa sulla
forma, frequenza e tipologie di raccomandazioni proposte da YouTube.
Abbiamo misurato e identificato delle soglie di *filter bubble*,
illustrando come i dati ottenuti per mezzo dei metodi "ufficiali" di
YouTube (le così dette API ufficiali) non corrispondano a quello che
viene osservato empiricamente da YTTRTEX.

### L'Analisi Continua: Verso un Ruolo Attivo degli Utenti di YouTube {#lanalisi-continua-verso-un-ruolo-attivo-degli-utenti-di-youtube .BOOK_Heading-3}

L'analisi che abbiamo intrapreso con l'esperimento descritto in
precendenza continua. Per ogni video in lingua visualizzata abbiamo
collezionato alcune centinaia di video correlati. A volte il titolo è
sufficentemente esplicativo da confermare come si tratti di una teoria
del complotto relativa alla pandemia. A volte si tratta invece di video
di *debunking* e non possiamo verificare con certezza la loro onestà
informativa. Poichè abbiamo la URL del video, possiamo verificare se i
video in questioni sono stati rimossi da YouTube in un secondo momento,
per esempio dopo il nostro test. Questa analisi qualitativa però
richiede un certo sforzo ed un adeguato metodo di valutazione che non
abbiamo ancora sviluppato. Ci sono analisi che ancora non abbiamo
esplorato, ad esempio: quanto sono recenti i video suggeriti? Si può da
qui stimare una vita media di un video? Quante sono le view?
Percentualmente le raccomandazioni sono prese da fonti validate con la
spunta blu o no? E ancora: perchè il video in arabo, per la totalità
delle volte in cui è stato visualizzato, era accompagnato da una
trasmissione Live in seconda posizione? Questo è l\'unico comportamento
fisso che abbiamo osservato, e richiede spiegazione nelle analisi
future. Inoltre, la nostra ricerca non si è avvalsa di un'analisi di
tipo qualitativo dei contenuti, vale a dire le teorie del complotto sul
COVID-19. Infatti per contestualizzare i nostri risultati, serve una
conoscenza approfondita della lingua in cui il contenuto è espresso e
del contesto in cui un certo contenuto viene visualizzato.

Ed è qui che entrano in gioco gli utenti di YouTube, che possono
pertanto partecipare in un'esperimento di resistenza attiva al potere
centralizzato della piattaforma. Il nostro approccio prevede la
distribuzione delle responsabilità e dei ruoli, e il coinvolgimento
attivo del maggior numero possibile di utenti delle piattaforme come
YouTube---utenti che parlano cinese, arabo, spagnolo o portoghese,
possono ancora essere d\'aiuto. Solo così potremmo, da una parte,
diventare utenti consapevoli, e dall'altra, avere sufficienti dati a
disposizione per dimostrare come quello che abbiamo chiamato
"imperialismo delle piattaforme" agisce nella vita di tutti i giorni, e
quali siano le conseguenze sulla nostra visione del mondo.

## Living with Instalive in Iran: Social Media use in Authoritarian Countries During the Pandemic (Hossein Kermani & Maria Faust)  {#living-with-instalive-in-iran-social-media-use-in-authoritarian-countries-during-the-pandemic-hossein-kermani-maria-faust .BOOK_Heading-2}

COVID-19 has become the "new normal" and substantially altered the lives
of people across the world through new forms of online communication.
One of the most drastic changes to everyday life has been the increase
of digital and social media use, which imposed both opportunities and
challenges. Social media users make up 3.8 billion of the estimated 4.5
billion internet users worldwide, or almost 85% of overall internet
users. Since the surge of the pandemic, social media use has risen from
75 to 82 minutes per day for each person. Social distancing and
lockdowns during spring 2020 caused people to search for new forms of
connection through video chat. For example, as of 2020, TikTok has 1.5
billion users worldwide, and its number of downloads increased by more
than 100 million between the last quarter of 2019 and the first quarter
of 2020. Both TikTok and Douyin---the Chinese mainland, authoritarian
version---share the same censorship practices of Bytedance, even more so
in times of COVID-19. Instalive, the Instagram feature for live video
chat, surged as an alternative digital video format across the world.
While these statistics generally show changes in people's communicative
practices, they are even more important in authoritarian contexts such
as Iran.

### Social and Digital Context in Iran {#social-and-digital-context-in-iran .BOOK_Heading-3}

In Iran, the country in the Middle East with the most severe COVID-19
effects, social media use has also significantly increased. Iranian
users have been keen to adopt social media---Yahoo messenger, Twitter,
and Instagram---in their everyday life. Social media has played a
crucial role in contemporary political protests in Iran (e.g., the 2009
Green Movement). The popularity of social media in Iran can be
attributed to the fact that these platforms provide dissident Iranians,
who were traditionally deprived of access to mainstream media, with a
space to share their content with social networks. That is probably why
Iranians have continued to use social media through circumvention tools,
despite the state's disincentive actions like filtering, and hardliners
denouncing the platforms.

In 2020, following Telegram and WhatsApp, Instagram is the third most
used social media platform in Iran, with about 24 million users out of
84 million inhabitants. Instalive has become increasingly popular,
especially among Persian women. During lockdown, Instagram users
increased by about 31%, with some users using it 4 times as much as
before. Thus, Instalive affected people's communicative practices. For
instance, many Iranians who had not experienced online video chat
before, started to using Instalive to chat with their families and
friends. Besides such personal impacts, Instalive serves as an
alternative TV for Iranians, providing an opportunity for both media
practitioners and ordinary citizens to broadcast and consume their
favorite content, which they probably cannot access through national and
official media.

### Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting vs. Instalive as an Alternative TV in Iran {#islamic-republic-of-iran-broadcasting-vs.-instalive-as-an-alternative-tv-in-iran .BOOK_Heading-3}

Not only are all the official Iranian media severely controlled, but
operating private television channels and radio stations is strictly
prohibited in Iran. The Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting (IRIB),
Iran's national radio and television organization, has the exclusive
right to broadcast audio-visual content in national scale, and is
managed directly by state authorities. It mainly broadcasts
state-aligned content in order to underpin the state's hegemonic
discourse. In this regard, many dissident Iranians, including political
activists and public figures, such as singers and cinema stars (i.e.,
media practitioners), do not have any chance to be featured in its
programs. Iranian audiences have been deprived of watching their
favorite programs and figures on air. For instance, the IRIB, as well as
the other official media, are banned from mentioning the Iranian former
reformist president Mohamad Khatami. It has been argued that
blacklisting excludes individuals who never should be shown in Iran's
national TV, such as Mohammad Reza Shajarian, the most famous Iranian
singer.

In this restrictive context, both media practitioners and ordinary
citizens perceive Instalive as an alternative platform that can serve
their need to free audio-visual media. They are using this feature to
broadcast and consume forbidden content. Instalive was employed by some
of the presidential campaigns to advertise their candidates during the
2017 election, but its use intensified and diversified during the
lockdown. For example, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani used Instalive
to broadcast his presidential speeches as he argued that the IRIB
refused to publicly do that. Now, many of Iranian's celebrities and
microcelebrities use this platform to broadcast sexual and
socio-cultural content which are often prohibited under Islamic rules.

While no program about sex is allowed on the IRIB---even educative
programs or erotic scenes---Tataloo and Neda Yassi's Instalive broke the
record for viewers by more than 630,000. Tataloo is an Iranian rapper
who had more than 4 million followers at that time, and was well known
by his weird and unconventional behavior. However, his page was closed
by Instagram because of he was accused of child grooming. Yassi is also
an Instagram microcelebrity who is famous because of her sexual posts
and stories. Their Instalive was the perfect representation of
everything sexually forbidden in Iran. Tataloo and Yassi talked about
having group sex, explained sexual behavior, and promoted free relations
with many sexual partners. Given that the only acceptable form of sexual
relationship is marriage in Iran, this Instalive crossed all of the
state's "red lines" as well as broke IRIB policies.

Nevertheless, not all popular Instalives during the COVID-19 time were
as offensive to the state as this example. For instance, let us look at
the case of Aghamiri and Ahlam's Instalive. Hassan Aghamiri is clergy,
and Ahlam is an Iranian female singer; they actually represent two
hostile camps in Iran. Women's singing in public is forbidden in Iran,
and it is not conclusively allowed on the IRIB. This restriction is
allegedly exerted by the Islamic rules. In Iran, clergies are considered
to be the representatives of Islam. It is anticipated that clergies
condemn female singing and are not to be seen with them anywhere, as has
been the case since the Islamic revolution. To this extent, Instalive
disobeyed the state's Islamic rules, playing with socio-cultural
structures in Iran. A clergy co-singing with a female singer, happened
in that live show, is something that would never be seen on the IRIB.

These two examples show how Iranians use Instalive to overcome the
state's and IRIB's restrictions. Employing Instalive, media
practitioners produce content based on what is forbidden by the IRIB.
Such content gained the attention of Iranians who have been deprived of
such programs on national TV.

###  {#section-25 .BOOK_Heading-3}

### What[']{dir="rtl"}s Next? Instalive After COVID-19 {#whats-next-instalive-after-covid-19 .BOOK_Heading-3}

Instalive introduced new opportunities for citizens in closed societies
to share and discuss sensitive content. While Iranians use Twitter to
discuss politics, they use Instagram to play with the state's hard
cultural and social restrictions. As Iranians perform or watch
Instalives, they are undermining the power of the state-controlled TV.
Yet, the state clearly showed its intention to censor and control
Instalives. Ali Zolghadri, the deputy chief of Tehran's security police,
stated that they would cancel Instalive shows with obscene behaviour or
norm-breaking language. Despite such hard comments, Iranians manage to
find ways to circumvent the state's limitations. This time, they
transformed Instalive into an informal national TV. No matter if its use
will increase or decrease in the days after the COVID-19 crisis, it can
be assumed that Instalive will remain a serious competitor to the IRIB,
challenging its exclusivity and hegemony in more ways than we have seen
so far.

## COVID-19 and the Argentine Theatre (Nicolás Fuster) {#covid-19-and-the-argentine-theatre-nicolás-fuster .BOOK_Heading-2}

As soon as the summer holidays ended in February, the government of
Argentina, which had only taken office last December, experienced a
rather abrupt end to their honeymoon. The pandemic had started on the
other side of the globe. Then, it appeared in Europe. But for some
reason, the news of the sudden arrival in Argentina took the authorities
by surprise. "I did not believe that the virus would arrive this soon,"
the Minister of Health stated on March 9, 2020.[^483]

Ten days later, President Alberto Fernández ordered a total
quarantine.[^484] The decision found approval among the opposition party
and citizens that used social media to discuss the quarantine through
the hashtag \#QuedateEnCasa ("Stay home"). Like people in many other
countries, Argentines learned to bake bread and cakes through Instagram,
and several famous musicians such as Pedro Aznar and Kevin Johansen
performed live from their houses to help soothe fans. Some of these
home-made concerts reached peaks of almost 190.000 watchers. As days
went by, people also used social media---mainly through the hashtag
\#ArgentinaAplaude on Twitter---to organize for signing the national
hymn and to cheer the medical staff with massive applauses during the
evenings.[^485]

The NYTimes reported that Mr. Fernández's popularity was strong. He held
several press conferences together with the mayor of Buenos Aires, who
belongs to an opposition party. This dialogue and agreement were
appreciated by the citizenry, even if the long-term polarization did not
seem to disappear. By the end of April, the media reported that because
of COVID-19, some prisoners could leave the penitentiaries, which are
often overcrowded with unhygenic conditions.[^486] The possibility of
giving house arrest to a number of prisoners[^487], many of which were
sex offenders and would have lived close to their victims---if not in
the very same house[^488]---triggered a tough public response. A strong
*cacerolazo* (pot banging, an Argentine protesting method emerged during
the crisis of 2001) was heard in the main cities on April 30.[^489] The
response was truly intense, and Human Rights Watch stated that the
reaction was understandable, and sending prisoners to their places as a
temporary measure does not mean releasing them.[^490]

### Impatience {#impatience .BOOK_Heading-3}

Despite the calm style of the President, the announcement of the
quarantine being extended unsettled many Argentines. Argentina counts
almost half of its workers in the informal sector.[^491] A number of
them are day laborers, meaning that they buy provisions with their
meagre daily earnings. It started to become clear that the quarantine
was not an option for many, especially in the suburbs. Argentina has a
tradition of openness, and could not be labelled a xenophobic country.
However, due to COVID-19, aggressions towards Asians and Italians were
reported. Moreover, Argentines either infected or suspected to be
infected received threatening messages through social media, where fake
profiles were created in order to bully and insult the presumed
infected.

### Education {#education .BOOK_Heading-3}

Teachers are laboriously organizing classes through videos, WhatsApp,
and online platforms. In order to supply the lack of classes, the
Government sent a bill to the Congress for allowing teaching from afar.
The bill was smoothly approved by the lower house and will be soon voted
on in the Senate. In April, the Ministry of Education announced the
distribution of booklets as teaching materials, co-financed with UNICEF,
for students in vulnerable situations.[^492] A few days later, Carla
Carrizo, an opposition MP, noticed that the booklets had a strong
political content in favor of the national Government and cast the other
parties in a negative light. The 18 million booklets cost around EUR
4.000.000. "The first one to be educated should be the Ministry of
Education. Instead of indoctrinating kids, we should be discussing how
to raise critical minds," Mrs Carrizo said.[^493]

### The app {#the-app .BOOK_Heading-3}

Like in other countries, the Argentine authorities launched an app for
mobile phones, called CuidAr ("To take care," with a capital A that
combines "to take care" with Argentina). The app has a triple function:
is allows users to self-diagnose, be tracked, and process their
circulation permission. At the beginning, it was said that the app would
be mandatory, and later announced that it would be mandatory in some
provinces. This provoked criticisms from experts, especially on Twitter.
One of these, programmer and activist Javier Smaldone, said that the
government has not yet provided the source code nor the back-end in the
server.[^494] Another IT expert, Maximiliano Firtman, argued that apart
from not working well, the app lacks basic security standards.[^495] It
is rather easy to pretend to be someone else, there is no option to edit
information, and the government could share the data with third parties.
Eventually, the authorities decided not to make the app mandatory, but
to leave it as it is.

### Improvisation {#improvisation .BOOK_Heading-3}

During the press conference when a new extension of the quarantine was
announced, Mr. Fernández said that \"the quarantine will last for as
long as needed.\" When asked about the anxiety and anguish the lockdown
could have on the people, the President, visibly irritated, replied that
\"what is distressing is getting infected.\" His response unleashed
controversy over the emotional aspect of lockdown: the stress of the
uncertainty of workers and owners of SMEs, and the women who suffer
domestic violence. New cases of SARS-CoV-2 were recently reported in the
so-called villas, the Argentine equivalent to Brazilian favelas. In
Villa Itatí, a suburb of Buenos Aires, 10% tests were positive.[^496]
Within the capital city, an article showed that cases of COVID-19 in
precarious settlements were a third of the total cases.[^497] There were
a number of extremely poor urban areas where families lived in the very
same room, where social distancing is not an option and alcohol hand gel
is not widely used. By mid-April, the WHO placed Argentina among the
countries with less tests for COVID-19.[^498] If, as argued, the first
reaction of the authorities was appropriate, the last movements show
improvisation.

### "Comunitarism" {#comunitarism .BOOK_Heading-3}

The combined lockdown and delicate economic situation of the country hit
the most vulnerable. As soon as the quarantine started, Mosquito
Sancineto, an actor and drama teacher of the underground scene of
Avenida Corrientes, set up *Artistas Solidarios* ("Caring Artists").
This NGO received donations, prepared bags with food and cleaning
products, and distributed them to artists that cannot work because of
COVID-19. Adriana Yasky, who is in charge of the logistics, said,

"We have a bank account and we receive donations of 500 or 1.000 ARS
(Argentinian Peso, about 5 / 10 EUR), sometimes more. We asked a
nutritionist to prepare a list of foodstuffs, so we know that what we
provide is healthy. We also give bleach and soap. In addition, we
provide psychological support by volunteer professionals. A little idea
of Mosquito is getting to be noticed thanks to social media: many famous
artists such as Carla Peterson, who has over one million followers on
Instagram, did a live with us. Others, like cartoonist Maitena, sent us
their support. We have been contacted by other artists in the rest of
the country who want to help, hence Artistas Solidarios is now working
also in Mar del Plata. We use social media for everything: for asking
for donations, for letting artists know that we are here to help. I am
the one who reads the messages, then I make a table of the distribution,
according to the requests of the week. A group goes to the wholesale
supermarket and prepare the bags, and the guys with the cars deliver
them. Donations are precious so we must spend wisely. We were lucky to
find volunteers that, because of their jobs, hold the circulation
permission! We deliver more than 100 bags each Saturday, and the number
is increasing and increasing. All of this would be impossible without
social media and WhatsApp."

### Digital Activism {#digital-activism .BOOK_Heading-3}

On June 3, 2015, there was a massive demonstration against violence
against women in Argentina. Twitter, Facebook and Instagram played a
role under the slogan \#NiUnaMenos ("Not one less"). Since then, the
movement increased and crossed borders in Argentina and Latin America.
It also arrived in Spain and Italy under the slogan \#NonUnaDiMeno. Five
years after the first rally in Argentina, digital platforms were
essential again; activists launched a *ruidazo* ("big noise") on Twitter
and Instagram.

### Next {#next .BOOK_Heading-3}

So far, Argentines have followed the rules and have also shown
creativity and respect. Now, the improvisation phase should be over. If
politics has a vision, it ought to perform like actors do after months
of rehearsing, when they know what the next scene will be like, and how
the play is going to end.

##  {#section-26 .BOOK_Heading-2}

## COVID-19 and Non-Personal Data in the Indian Context: On the Normative Ideal of Public Interest (Preeti Raghunath) {#covid-19-and-non-personal-data-in-the-indian-context-on-the-normative-ideal-of-public-interest-preeti-raghunath .BOOK_Heading-2}

The southwestern Indian state of Kerala has been in the news for
flattening the curve in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, raising the
bar for public health interventions through proactive and informed
policy stances. However, another storm was brewing for a few weeks in
April and early May that had implications for the larger public health
crisis. Opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala questioned the state
government upon entering into a contract with a private firm, Sprinklr,
which would be granted full access to citizens' health data. This led to
petitions being filed in the Kerala High Court, and the judge ordering
that the data of COVID-19 patients with Sprinklr be anonymised. Several
days before the original post from which this chapter is drawn was
written, the Kerala government told the High Court that the data had
been transferred to a State-owned cloud space. While this incident, in
the midst of a global pandemic, speaks to ongoing discussions on the
data privacy and healthcare cybersecurity, it also highlights what is
emerging as an important domain in data governance: non-personal data.

### Defining Non-Personal Data {#defining-non-personal-data .BOOK_Heading-3}

There is not yet a definition of non-personal data in the Indian
context. However, it is generally defined by its nature of not being
personal data. While the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019 is before
the Joint Parliamentary Committee, the Indian government has now
instituted a panel to examine Non-Personal Data (NPD). Non-personal data
is anonymized or pseudonymized data, stripped of the potential to be
traced back to an individual. My concern in the remainder of this piece
is to examine NPD as a public good in the context of data ownership
concerns, COVID-19, and the health sector.

### Ownership and Public Interest {#ownership-and-public-interest .BOOK_Heading-3}

Non-Personal Data is often misunderstood as "big data." It may be part
of big data stacks in form, but any anonymized and pseudonymized data
could be called NPD. It could exist in the form of big data or thick
data, especially in the case of smaller enterprises and local commercial
setups. Whatever its form, NPD has immense value to be exploited
economically. Srinivas Kodali, an independent researcher on open data,
spoke to me about the new National Health Stack in India. He told me,
"The National Health Stack is essentially a plan by the Indian "Big
Tech" lobby to push monetization of anonymized health data for profit.
This often leads to the pushing of technology onto people through
coercion." He tweeted about how the Stack is less concerned with
healthcare, and more about rendering the individual as data. Kris
Gopalakrishnan is Co-Founder of Infosys, a big Indian technology firm
heading the Committee formed by the Indian government. This overlap
makes it difficult to dismiss concerns of the ownership of NPD. In
envisaging NPD as an economic asset, one must be wary of the collusion
of the state and "Big Tech" to amass profits and profile citizens.

### COVID-19 and Non-Personal Data {#covid-19-and-non-personal-data .BOOK_Heading-3}

Questions of data ownership and public interest are normative ideals in
any democratic policy process and democratic practice. In the case of
NPD, it becomes imperative to advocate for data to be treated as a
public good. The humanitarian concerns of the COVID-19 situation only
accentuate and highlight the need to draw on these ideals. In light of
the security concerns of the Aarogya Setu mobile application and the
Indian experience of trusting "Big Tech" with a public data-driven
process like Aadhaar, only makes a case for advocating for approaching
individual and community data as non-rival and reusable public goods.
Aadhaar is a biometric identity system put in place by the government to
onboard citizens. Aarogya Setu is an app that was put in place by the
government to manage medical data and diagnose COVID-19 cases. Both
Aadhaar and Aarogya Setu have come under scathing criticism for evading
privacy, relying on identity markers, exhibiting poor security
architectures, and generally being used by the government to control the
population. The Indian government announced that it would be making the
Aarogya Setu app open-source. In response, those championing privacy and
security accused the government of "openwashing" by not sharing the
right source code. The recent case of the Tablighi Jamaat controversy
saw right-wing forces blaming the entire Muslim community for allegedly
conspiring to spread COVID-19. It serves as an example of how technology
and apps could promote profiling of individuals by religion, caste, and
other identity markers.

These issues should direct our attention to the larger practices of data
management of NPD, in the face of COVID-19. For instance, practices of
open data and sharing of datasets between civil society actors and small
technology firms working with them could aid the process of promoting
pertinent healthcare facilities. Similarly, data standards need to be
aligned with commonly accepted principles, since data could accentuate
or diminish the complexity of a pandemic. Proponents of openness also
suggest that scientific research and other literature on the pandemic
need to be shared openly to accelerate finding new pathways for
diagnosis. Next, working with NPD exclusively would mean that
segregation and selection of data need to be enabled, to account for the
removal of personal data and associated concerns of privacy erosion. The
segregation and selection process would require proactive efforts from
technologists and those in power to enable the maintenance of data for
public usage, since there are efforts by liberal economists to downplay
privacy concerns during times of the pandemic.

The Indian government must facilitate such processes to engage with the
larger community of activists, advocates, technology experts,
innovators, and human rights proponents who work in the public interest.
Caution must be shown to ensure that working with NPD does not become an
exercise in technocracy, and remains an inclusive and open process. This
inclusivity must extend to the policymaking domain as well, creating new
pathways for deliberation. The recent exercise by the government of
putting out a report on NPD in the public domain has generated
discussion on what could govern such data in India. Lack of a public
interest mandate in the same, and the impetus given to a possible
"nationalization" of data, has been seen as a cause for worry by
industry, and more importantly, by civil society. The ideas of data
trusts, community privacy, and community data, though encouraging, is
not sufficiently defined to block loopholes for manipulation. India's
entrenched migrant crisis and travel concerns of citizens demonstrate
that COVID-19 warrants such an act of urgent advocacy in favour of
public interest. Rapid datafication of livelihood and socio-economic
processes in India would only serve "Big Tech" and the state, if we lose
this opportunity to design data-related policymaking and policies in
public interest.

## Argentina-Brasil: La Resignificación del uso de la Tecnología en Épocas de Pandemia (Julián Cordoba Pivotto)  {#argentina-brasil-la-resignificación-del-uso-de-la-tecnología-en-épocas-de-pandemia-julián-cordoba-pivotto .BOOK_Heading-2}

In a world in constant evolution, Latin America is probably where the
COVID-19 pandemic has most changed the way we communicate as a society.
This chapter reviews the cases of Argentina and Brazil to illustrate how
the use of technology can foster different scenarios of resistance and
alterity.

La situación del COVID-19 ha cambiado la manera de comunicarnos como
sociedad. No importa en qué país y situación nos encontremos; de una u
otra manera estamos afectados por las consecuencias de esta pandemia y
uno de los factores principales y más presentes en este cambio es el uso
de la tecnología. Gracias a ella es posible prolongar y continuar con
ciertos aspectos de nuestra vida como el trabajo, el estudio o el
encuentro con amigos y familiares. A la vez, también es interesante ver
cómo la tecnología nos permite vincularnos de nuevas y diferentes
maneras con los gobiernos, que juegan un papel fundamental en esta
situación, debido al poder de decisión que tienen.

Sucede que, poco después de que el contagio se esparciera en primer
lugar por Asia, Europa, y Norteamérica, llegó el turno de que los
mandatarios y líderes de América Latina se enfrenten a los desafíos que
trae esta cuestión, adaptándose y concentrándose en las características
propias que tiene esta parte del mundo. Así, en un lugar donde se
encuentran alteridad, resistencia, subversión y creatividad -como lo
sugieren Milán y Treré[^499]---, los líderes han tomado posiciones y
estrategias muy disímiles entre sí, como en el caso de Argentina y
Brasil. Como resultado, los habitantes de esos países han respondido de
maneras distintas a cada una de estas estrategias. Este artículo revisa
estas estrategias y estas respuestas, para entender cómo se dio el uso
de la tecnología en cada ocasión y pensar en qué situaciones se
distinguen las características que hacen de la región un lugar tan
particular. Para eso, es conveniente revisar cada caso por separado.

### Argentina  {#argentina .BOOK_Heading-3}

Este país fue uno de los primeros en decretar un aislamiento
obligatorio, que aplicó para el total del territorio nacional y sólo
tuvo como excepción a aquellos considerados "personal de servicio
esencial", como el personal médico o aquellos ligados a la producción y
comercialización de alimentos y medicamentos. La tecnología jugó un rol
principal para la gestión del gobierno: cada transmisión en televisión
para comunicar las medidas elegidas se vio reforzada por una fuerte
campaña de concientización en redes sociales, con indicaciones sobre qué
podían hacer los ciudadanos para evitar los contagios. Un dato
interesante es el aprovechamiento de la emergente red social Tik Tok:
allí, la cuenta del Ministerio de Salud de Argentina publica consejos
para evitar el contagio con un mensaje simple y sencillo, mayormente
dirigido a jóvenes, que es el grupo que mayor actividad tiene en esa
red.

El gobierno argentino también utilizó la tecnología para desarrollar una
aplicación para smartphones, como sucedió en otras partes del mundo. En
este caso se trata de CuidAR, una aplicación de descarga obligatoria
para quienes requieran el permiso de circulación, que da un
autodiagnóstico basado en los síntomas que indique el usuario. Sin
embargo, ante la aparición de esta aplicación, los expertos explican que
podría no tener el resultado esperado, ya que no queda claro qué hace el
gobierno con los datos que se recolectan, o cómo se usan.[^500] Además,
dado que la aparición de síntomas podría restringir el permiso, algunos
usuarios podrían optar por simplemente mentir al ingresar esos datos. La
aplicación, blanco de críticas por vulneración a la privacidad, no
pareciera tener un futuro muy optimista.

Por otro lado, los argentinos y las argentinas también supieron
aprovechar la tecnología. Gran parte de la población, aquellos que
cuentan con un dispositivo con acceso a internet, aprovecharon este
medio para continuar con sus trabajos, clases, reuniones y obligaciones.
Sin embargo, no sólo se usaron para eso, sino también para mantener
contacto con el gobierno y expresar tanto su apoyo como su
disconformidad. Un ejemplo de esto es el uso de Twitter, que se
convirtió en el lugar principal para organizar muestras de apoyo hacia
el personal de salud: así nacen los aplausos desde los balcones, cada
día a las 21hs como hora pactada.

Pero esos balcones también fueron escenario de otro tipo de expresiones,
como las manifestaciones en contra de la misma decisión del gobierno.
Sucede que, pasados más de 70 días desde la declaración del aislamiento,
una parte de la población decidió manifestar quejas y malestar, alegando
la defensa de cuestiones como la actividad económica y la caída del
consumo. El modus operandi de la organización fue la misma que para el
agradecimiento al personal de salud: otra vez las redes sociales en
general y Twitter en particular fueron protagonistas. En la actualidad,
esta movilización ha tenido respuesta, las demandas fueron escuchadas y
se han flexibilizado algunos sectores del país para que parte de la
población pueda volver a trabajar.

### Brasil {#brasil .BOOK_Heading-3}

El país vecino tuvo una respuesta institucional y poblacional distinta a
los efectos de la pandemia. Desde el gobierno, la respuesta fue
totalmente distinta a la argentina: su presidente ha calificado al virus
como "un resfriadito"[^501] y no ha decretado ningún tipo de
aislamiento, explicando que priorizaba la actividad económica en su
lugar.

El gobierno hizo una campaña con este posicionamiento: con el hashtag
\#oBrasilNãoPodeParar, justificaba su postura por la negativa de detener
la producción y la actividad laboral. La idea del gobierno, al parecer,
era que la base de apoyo de Bolsonaro reproduzca y comparta el hashtag
para demostrar apoyo a esta incitativa, apoyo que no se dio en redes ni
por medio de la tecnología, sino en las calles, del modo habitual y sin
respetar el aislamiento social. Allí también, el presidente se hizo
presente.

Pero el uso del hashtag no fue solamente por parte del oficialismo
brasileño. Del otro lado, también hubo -con mayor expansión y éxito-
cierto activismo: con el slogan \#ForaBolsonaro, que ya había sido usado
anteriormente, alentado y difundido por referentes sociales, líderes de
opinión y figuras opositoras, se dio respuesta a la campaña oficialista.

De un modo diferente, otra gran parte de la población de Brasil tuvo una
respuesta distinta ante esta (in)acción por parte del gobierno nacional.
Se trata de los habitantes de
las [favelas](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/25/rio-favelas-coronavirus-brazil),
quienes habitan zonas donde viven los sectores más económicamente
empobrecidos de la sociedad brasileña. En Rocinha, Río de Janeiro, los
habitantes empezaron a comunicarse por servicios de mensajería,
como WhatsApp, para organizar una cuarentena "autogestionada", que
consistía en un horario límite para la circulación por la zona. En
Paraisópolis, São Paulo, se creó la figura del "Presidente de Calle": un
vecino voluntario que se encarga de vigilar y dar apoyo a las 50
familias de su entorno más próximo, quien debe alertar si alguno de los
habitantes que vigila presenta alguno de los síntomas, para así hacer
más inmediata la atención médica.[^502]

En ambas zonas, además, los mismos vecinos junto a algunos voluntarios
de distintas organizaciones entregaron los llamados "COVID-19 kits", que
incluyen tapabocas y jabón. La comunicación por servicios de mensajería
sirvió para orientar y mejorar su distribución, fundamental para estos
habitantes que -en su mayoría- tienen empleos informales y debido a esto
la imposibilidad de continuar con ellos o recibir ingresos.

Teniendo en cuenta las características de este tipo de hogares, en los
que suelen vivir 10 personas en construcciones de hasta 3 habitaciones
-como menciona una activista en este
[reportaje](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbQyU-clUSg&feature=emb_title)-,
sumado a la falta de información y reacción por parte del gobierno
nacional, es necesario actuar. Así lo consideraron los voluntarios y
vecinos, quienes decidieron compartir información sobre medidas de
distanciamiento social y prevención de los contagios en un contexto en
el que proveer información es de vital importancia. Aquí, nuevamente los
servicios de mensajería jugaron un factor fundamental.

### Conclusión {#conclusión .BOOK_Heading-3}

Los casos de Argentina y Brasil nos permiten ver cómo responde la
población ante las acciones del gobierno, apoyando o manifestándose en
contra; en cualquier caso, expresándose. Estos fenómenos reflejan una
ciudadanía involucrada. En Argentina, el descontento se manifiesta en
demandas de carácter predominantemente económico. En Brasil, por otro
lado, las demandas son por mejoras sanitarias. Lo destacable de la
comparación entre ambos es la forma en la que se involucran sus
poblaciones: la ciudadanía se preocupa, decide comunicar y actúa en
consecuencia: todo eso como resultado de la pandemia y gracias a la
tecnología. El nuevo desafío será que, una vez superada esta situación,
ese compromiso se mantenga. Ojalá así sea.

## A Brazilian Cautionary Tale on Pandemic Negationism: Open Data is an Essential Safeguard for Evidence-Based Policy-Making (Nicoló Zingales)  {#a-brazilian-cautionary-tale-on-pandemic-negationism-open-data-is-an-essential-safeguard-for-evidence-based-policy-making-nicoló-zingales .BOOK_Heading-2}

When it comes to COVID-19 deaths, Brazil is the second hardest hit
country in the world, reaching almost 130.000 deaths at the time of
writing. This may be surprising to those who remember that, when the
novel coronavirus made its way to Brazil, after having caused thousands
of deaths in other countries such as China and Italy, there was a widely
shared belief that the warm temperatures in the country would prevent
its spread. Perhaps this bolstered the confidence of the country's
President Jair Bolsonaro when he minimized the importance of the virus
by criticizing the "oversized" concern for its destructive power and
attaching economic motives to its exaggeration.[^503] What was more
puzzling, however, is that the President maintained a negationist
approach despite the steady increase in the numbers of victims, and
contradicted the instructions given by health authorities, state
governors and even his own Health Minister.

On March 24, 2020, Bolsonaro gave a national address on television, in
which he revealed the key tenets of his strategy to fight the pandemic:
first, a preoccupation for the economic consequences, demonstrated by
his admonition that "life goes on, and jobs must be maintained."[^504]
Second, a forceful rejection of the social isolation imposed by state
and municipal authorities, combined with an exhortation to "vertical"
isolation, meaning separating those segments of the population with
higher risk of death or of developing serious conditions with COVID-19.
In support of that strategy, he suggested that for most people the virus
would be no more than a gripezinha ("small flu"), and that Brazilians
have somehow acquired an immunity to disease by "diving into sewers" (a
reference to the fact that in certain areas of Brazil people have to
cope with sewage water pouring onto the streets).[^505] Third, Bolsonaro
encouraged investment in demonstrating the efficacy of
hydroxychloroquine against the virus.

While one could oppose this strategy on ideological grounds, a different
criticism concerns how it was reached. The strategy marked a stark
contrast with the position advocated by scientific authorities, and it
was devoid of evidence. The first telling sign of these problems was the
dismissal on April 16 of the Health Minister Mandetta, due to a
divergence of views over the necessity of social isolation
measures.[^506] This was followed not a month later by the resignation
of his replacement, Nelson Teich, appointed by Bolsonaro to find a
better ally on the economy-focused strategy. Although Teich did not
provide any reasons for the resignation, it is worth noting that it came
the day after he learned in a press conference that the President had
issued a decree. Without consulting the Ministry, he classified gyms,
beauty salons, and barbers as "essential services" that cannot be
interrupted by state and municipal authorities.[^507] In later
declarations, Teich explained that he had weighed the government's
request to the Federal Council of Medicine to allow the prescription of
chloroquine for mild cases of COVID-19 in his resignation, stressing
that the country's health care budget is too small to be used for things
that don't work.[^508] The epilogue of this saga was the official
government guidelines for wider use of chloroquine in mild cases,
published when the Health Ministry came under the control of Eduardo
Pazuello, an active-duty army general. The decision to authorize the use
of hydroxychloroquine was reached unilaterally, despite the existence of
scientific studies on the medicine finding "no beneficial effect against
the disease," and without revealing any results from the studies
announced by the President in his television address in March.
Especially considering the delicate nature of this decision, which was
liable to impact lives of thousands of people, it was logical to expect
that the evidence for his decision would be produced and made available
for public oversight.

Another tension with the scientific community arose on June 5, when the
Health Ministry removed statistics about the novel coronavirus from its
portal, explaining that it doubted the accuracy of the numbers due to
the prevalence of "sub-notifications." It was alleged that numbers were
manipulated by states and municipalities in order to receive emergency
aid, and as a result, new reports would limit the numbers of deaths that
occurred each day.[^509] These changes involved significantly curtailing
published data. In the new version made available on June 7, one could
only see daily contagions, deaths, and recoveries without reference to
the running total. The new version also didn't permit a breakdown of
numbers by state or municipality, or comparisons with Severe Acute
Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) records, another useful indicator. In this
version, numbers could also no longer be downloaded, which created
obstacles to further analysis.[^510] All this motivated the
Sustainability Network, the Communist Party of Brazil, and the Socialism
and Freedom Party to launch a constitutionality challenge against the
new policy, resulting in a judicial order to the health ministry to
revert to the original configuration. Supreme Court Judge Alexandre de
Moraes mentioned in his decision that the Brazilian Constitution
enshrined the principle of publicity as one of the main vectors for
public administration, giving it absolute priority in the
administration's management and granting full access to information to
the entire society.[^511] The same principle had been invoked by the
judge in another ruling against the government in March, setting aside a
decree that created an exception in the law of access to information due
to the pandemic. According to the ruling, the decree "ha\[d\] not
established exceptional and concrete situations that would
\[legitimately\] impede access to information"---rather simply turning
the principle of publicity and transparency into an exception. In both
cases, the Judge spoke clearly: the pandemic cannot be used as an excuse
to lower transparency standards, which are indispensable to hold those
in power accountable, arguably even more so during the pandemic.

A third example of negationism and rupture with evidence-based policy
was the case of "*O Brasil não pode parar*," a media campaign
encouraging autonomous workers to continue working despite the
imposition of social isolation measures. The video of the campaign was
published on the official Instagram page of the Special Secretariat of
Communication of the Presidency and shared by several people close to
the President. However, the video's distribution was immediately stopped
by a court in Rio de Janeiro. Their injunction followed a complaint
lodged by the Federal Public Minister to prevent the spread from
official government accounts of this campaign, as well as other
information against social isolation that is not grounded in scientific
evidence. Interestingly, when these facts were brought to light by the
Press, the Secretariat denied the existence of the campaign, despite its
wide circulation and the public availability of screenshots of its
publication by the Secretariat just three days prior.[^512]

While the nation-wide campaign was withdrawn, Bolsonaro remains able to
use his own channel (TV Bolsonaro) to broadcast content of choice to his
audience through an app. According to an article published by the
Intercept on June 15, TV Bolsonaro is the main channel in the Mano app,
produced by IP.TV. This is the contractor preferred by state governments
of São Paulo, Paraná, Amazonas e Pará for the provision of long-distance
education to primary and secondary schools during the pandemic. The
Intercept documented that the livestreaming app requires users to allow
collecting of personal data, and suggested that this disproportionate
data collection may have been the economic value justifying IP.TV's
provision of such services free of charge to the state
governments.[^513] Unfortunately, no further information is available on
these contracts between state governments and IP.TV, and it is not clear
what safeguards were included to protect the personal data of millions
of students and professors. This lack of clarity over data processing
has been a reality for the entire duration of the pandemic in Brazil.

The country still awaits the entry of a comprehensive data protection
law and the formation of a data protection authority. Both have been
repeatedly postponed[^514], but are now reportedly bound to happen in
the next few days.[^515] While public-private partnerships could in
principle help the country to deliver services and information to
citizens, the current inadequacy of the applicable data protection
framework is such that these partnerships must be regarded with
suspicion. It is not a coincidence that the revelation of the terms of
the partnership between telecom operators and the Agency for Statistics
for the measurement of unemployment led to a successful constitutional
challenge, on grounds of the insufficiency of the applicable
safeguards.[^516] This Supreme Court ruling was a good reminder of the
promises of transparency and open data, highlighted by Judge de Moraes
in the two above-mentioned cases, which allowed direct citizen
engagement with evidence to keep public in check. Perhaps more
transparency and evidence-based policies could have prevented the
normalization of agglomerations we are seeing today across the country.

## Towards Civil Data Policies: Participatory Safeguards in COVID-19 Times (Arne Hintz) {#towards-civil-data-policies-participatory-safeguards-in-covid-19-times-arne-hintz .BOOK_Heading-2}

The pervasive tracing, tracking, and analysing of citizens and
populations has emerged as the tradeoff of an increasingly datafied
world. Citizens are becoming more transparent to the major
data-collecting institutions of the platform economy and the state,
while they have limited possibilities to intervene into processes of
data governance, control the data that is collected about them, and
affect how they are profiled and assessed through data assemblages. The
COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the centrality of these dynamics.
Contact tracing and detailed identification of outbreak clusters have
been essential responses to COVID-19. Yet, detailed data about our
movements, interactions and pastimes is now tracked, stored, and
analysed, both "online" through the use of contact-tracing apps and
"offline" (e.g., when we fill in a form at a bar or restaurant). The
rise of tracking raises the question of how exactly data is collected
and analysed, by whom, for what purposes, and with what limitations.
Essentially, it signals the necessity of legal safeguards to ensure that
data analytics fulfil their purpose while preventing privacy
infringements, discrimination, and the misuse of data. The COVID-19
pandemic thus alerts us to the importance of effective regulatory
frameworks that protect the rights and freedoms of digital citizens. It
also demands public involvement in a debate that affects our lives
during the pandemic.

The wider context of data policy in the wake of major data controversies
by both public and commercial institutions---from the Snowden
revelations to Cambridge Analytica---is currently ambiguous. On the one
hand, it reflects a deeply entrenched commitment to expansive data
collection. On the other hand, it increasingly recognises the need for
enhanced data protection and citizens' data rights. In many countries,
the possibilities for monitoring people's data traces (particularly by
state agencies) has significantly expanded. The UK Investigatory Powers
Act from 2016 serves as a stark example, because it legalised a broad
range of measures, including the "bulk collection" of people's data and
communication; the "internet connection records" (i.e., people's web
browsing habits); and "computer network exploitation" (i.e.,
state-sponsored hacking into the networks of companies and other
governments as well as the devices of individual citizens).[^517]

At the same time as these encroachments, we have also seen the
strengthening of data protection rules, most prominently by the European
Union General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in 2018. The GDPR
enhances citizen control over data by providing rights to access and
withdraw personal data, request an explanation for data use, and deny
consent to data tracking by platforms. It requires that data be
collected only for specific purposes to reduce indiscriminate data
sharing and trading. The GDPR also limits the processing of sensitive
personal data. While some elements of the GDPR have been controversial
and the regulation overall is often described as insufficient, it has
been recognised as an important building block towards a
citizen-oriented data policy framework.[^518] The emerging policy
environment of data collection and data use has been significant in
societies that are increasingly governed through data analysis and
processes of automated decision-making. Profiling citizens and
segmenting populations through detailed analysis of personal and
behavioural data are now at the core of governance processes and shape
state-citizen relations.[^519]

What does the shifting data environment mean during COVID-19 times? How
should regulatory frameworks enable and constrain the tracking and
tracing of virus outbreaks, and what boundaries should exist? If we
accept that some data collection and analysis is useful to address the
pandemic and its serious health implications, the purpose limitation of
this data (as highlighted by the GDPR) becomes crucial. In some
countries, contact-tracing apps were designed to track a much wider
range of data than initially necessary for tracing infection chains and
enable government agencies to use that data for non-medical tracking
purposes. In order to avoid contact-tracing becoming a Trojan Horse for
widespread citizen surveillance, strict purpose limitation would be an
essential cornerstone of a robust regulatory framework. Similarly,
limitations to the collection of sensitive data and the deletion of all
data at fixed times during or after the pandemic would be core
components of such a framework. While it may be debatable whether wider
data collection and sharing would be acceptable as long as the affected
individuals give their consent, a consent model often leads to pressures
and incentives for citizens to hand over data against their will, and
interest would make strict prohibitions seem a more appropriate
mechanism. The COVID-19 contact-tracing case thus points to some of the
elements that are increasingly discussed and regulated as part of policy
reforms such as the GDPR, and it highlights the challenges of
indiscriminate data collection.

Indiscriminate data collection also poses questions about who should
develop such policy, and whether broader public involvement would be
desirable or even necessary. The COVID-19 pandemic helps us explore the
role of citizens as policy actors. Contributions to the regulatory and
legislative environment by civic actors outside the realm of traditional
"policymakers" have received increased attention in recent years. These
new civil society actors in multi-stakeholder policy processes include
social movements[^520], "crowd law"[^521], and "policy hacking".[^522]
The COVID-19 case demonstrates multiple dimensions of these kinds of
public engagement. It shows the strong normative role of technical
developers arguing for decentralised data storage options in
contact-tracing apps (e.g., the Decentralised Privacy-Preserving
Proximity Tracing project), who have prevailed in many cases over the
initial government intention to centralise data handling. Further, we
have seen legal scholars taking the lead in proposing relevant
legislative frameworks, for example, by developing a dedicated
Coronavirus Safeguards Bill for the UK (which has not, so far, been
adopted by the UK government but has still influenced the debate on
contact-tracing).[^523] The public discourse on COVID-19 responses in
many countries has also considered the problem of data collection and
possible privacy infringements, thus placing data analytics firmly on
the public agenda.[^524]

The current pandemic has shown that emergency situations require the
rapid adoption of legal safeguards, and a wider public debate on what
data analyses are acceptable and where boundaries lie. Policy components
from recent regulatory frameworks such as the GDPR can be an important
part of this endeavour, as should critical reflection on data extraction
laws such as the Investigatory Powers Act. Expert proposals from civil
society have promoted rules that address problems raised by the pandemic
while protecting civic rights. At the "margins" of established policy
processes, these interventions by civil society and the public play a
significant role in advancing normative pressure on civic data policies.

# Theme V: Pandemic Solidarities and Resistance From Below  {#theme-v-pandemic-solidarities-and-resistance-from-below .BOOK_Heading-1}

## In Memory of COVID-19 in China: Forms of Digital Resistance Towards Censorship (Kinoko Merini) {#in-memory-of-covid-19-in-china-forms-of-digital-resistance-towards-censorship-kinoko-merini .BOOK_Heading-2}

COVID-19, an epidemic that emerged from Wuhan city, has been always
entangled with information censorship since it was detected. During the
last week of December 2019, doctors in Wuhan---including Dr. Li Wenliang
who became known as the virus whistleblower---used their personal social
media accounts to sound the alarm about the rapid spread of the unknown
disease.[^525] Their attempt was stigmatised by local authorities as
"spreading rumours and misinformation." Even in the times of COVID-19,
the Chinese internet witnessed a battle between censorship and
resistance by Chinese citizens and journalists. They used digital
networked communication to spread censored content and fight for the
right to be informed. This created a temporal "us" against the
authorities' state.

Nick Couldry offered a critical reflection on how digital networked
communication forms solidarity---what he termed "the myth of us"
(2014).[^526] He argued that timescale mattered as one of the social
conditions of political changes, because networked action provided
effective means for disrupting government surveillance and quickly
mobilizing citizens. Yet, the long-term contexts that guarantee
sustainable individual action in and through networks are missing.
Couldry also said that it is too early to conclude that digital networks
function as a process of autonomous communication. Nonetheless, he did
not deny the potential of political change through social movements that
use of digital networks. We can think of how COVID-19 outlined and
amplified the problems of internet censorship in China, which triggered
resistance that could become legacies for activists and citizens even
after the crisis.

### GitHub: The New Frontier of Data Activism in China {#github-the-new-frontier-of-data-activism-in-china .BOOK_Heading-3}

Documentation of COVID-19 reports on the software repository GitHub
reveal a form of data activism as a novel frontier of media
activism.[^527] As Milan argues, it is a re-active action enacted by
technological experts who use web crawling or other data collection
processes to transfer reports and articles to the repositories, racing
against the speed of censorship.[^528] "Terminus2049," an online
crowd-sourcing project relying on GitHub, was set up in 2018 to archive
articles that were censored from mainstream media outlets and social
media platforms such as WeChat and Weibo. As stated in its GitHub page,
the project's slogan is "no more 404"---the error code indicating that a
server could not find the requested page. Terminus2049 functions as a
site of resistance towards the state censorship on media content.

During the outbreak of COVID-19 in China, Terminus2049 archived and
documented reports and articles that had been censored or removed. These
reports included in-depth reports questioning the local Wuhan
government's early reaction to the coronavirus published by Caixin
Media. On April 19, three volunteers from Terminus2049[^529] went
missing in Beijing and were presumed to be detained by the
authorities.[^530] However, Terminus2049 is not the only project on
GitHub that is involved in crowdsourcing documentation of coronavirus
memories. Similar projects such as "2019ncovmemory" (which has already
set their archive to private to avoid risks), "womenincov"[^531] (which
features recordings of female medical staff and issues related to
domestic violence), and "workerundervirus"[^532] can be also found on
GitHub.

How did GitHub become a platform for Chinese citizens and activists to
preserve counter-narratives? To begin with, the software development
website GitHub is accessible in China for its usual function of sharing
code. The platform gained its visibility outside the developer
communities during the Anti-996 Movement in 2019, initiated by Chinese
programmers to protest again excessive working conditions in tech
companies.[^533] As part of the movement, the "996.ICU" project was
devoted to compiling a list of companies that follow a 996-working
schedule (from 9 AM to 9 PM, 6 days a week). This repository quickly
became one of GitHub's fastest-growing repositories. Through mainstream
media reporting and the wide-spread discussion about 996-working culture
in China, the movement brought people's attention to GitHub as a
suitable site for civic participation. The platform was also a tactical
choice for organizing contemporary activism in China, given its capacity
to be operated both within and beyond "the Great Firewall."

### The Explosion of Creativities on Social Media {#the-explosion-of-creativities-on-social-media .BOOK_Heading-3}

I am not arguing that GitHub is the only online space to contain Chinese
citizens' memories of coronavirus and channel their demands for
transparency and accountability. In fact, social media accelerates
cycles of action and protest, which can produce new forms of
collectivity. What amazed me the most is how citizens creatively and
collectively expressed their anger, discontentment, and solidary by
spreading an interview of Dr. Ai Fen on social media platforms. On March
10, Renwu Magazine published an article titled "The one who gave out the
whistle (发哨子的人)"---an interview with the head of Emergency
Department in Wuhan Central Hospital, Dr. Ai Fen. She alleged that she
had been reprimanded by superior officials after attempting to warn her
colleagues about COVID-19 and her experiences in the emergency
department. The article was quickly removed, but censorship failed to
silence the public. Citizens found their own ways of preserving and
spreading the article: using screenshots, replacing words with emojis,
and formatting the article vertically instead of horizontally. More
creative people creatively used a series of QR codes, fictional
languages such as Klingon and Sindarin, Morse code, and the computer
science encoding system Base 64. Chinese social media platforms were
turned into battlefields against censorship. As communication scholar
Kecheng Fang commented to BBC, it was a ceremonial event that connected
individual citizens who share similar values and led to the formation of
solidarity.[^534]

### Alternative/Artistic New Media Projects {#alternativeartistic-new-media-projects .BOOK_Heading-3}

The creativities in this event brought forth the possibilities of
adapting alternative or artistic activism, while still being able to
communicate a social message. Such activism is often recognizable by its
ability to slip under the radar and not be identified as "politics" to
authorities. As Leah Lievrouw points out, besides citizens' active
engagement in spreading censored content regarding coronavirus on social
media platforms, activists have incorporated the concept of memories
into alternative and activist new media projects.[^535]

"Unfinished Farewell" is a new media project, directed by visual
designer Jiabao Li and Laobai Wu, that offers a place for people to
release their grief and for the public to mourn.[^536] By collecting
help-seeking posts and heartbreaking stories of losing the loved ones
from accounts on different social media platforms, the project
aggregates individual stories to form counter-hegemonic narratives. It
invites the visitors to reflect on a question: "after this pandemic, who
can remember the pain of someone like my mother who had nowhere to seek
medical treatment, being refused by the hospital, and died at home?"
There is a need to document similar tragedies as evidence to be used
later when seeking accountability after the crisis. This project set the
urgency for such a need in an emotionally powerful way, by presenting
information of the lost lives as a visualization.

"Qingming, A Sculpture of Resilience" has appeared online.[^537]
Qingming Festival, also known as Tomb-sweeping Day, is a day to mourn
and commemorate ancestors and lost loved ones. Because of the pandemic
measurements, people in China were unable to visit graves in this year's
Qingming Festival, so they used online tomb-sweeping applications as an
alternative. However, the project was not created for tomb-sweeping. It
invites you to virtually join a counter-clockwise walk in front of the
Hongshan Auditorium in Wuhan. It aims to transform the trajectories left
by visitors into an online monument, which represents a collective will
of remembering how the officials were trying to silence the alarms about
the coronavirus in Wuhan. As strongly stated on the website, "We shall
never forget our pain and tear. Neither should we stop examining the
systematic problems exposed during the crisis, the strive for a better
future." Despite that the state's regulations and pandemic measurements
prohibit citizens from gathering physically in front of Hongshan
Auditorium in Wuhan, the project records an artistic form of protest
online.

The political environment and the strict censorship conducted by
corporate social media platforms in contemporary China hampered the
possibility for organizing physical protests or forming grassroots
collectives. The COVID-19 crisis triggered an intensity that lasts for
months in everyday life, but it also nurtured creative and alternative
resistances that could go beyond physical protests. Despite that fact
that one should be cautious, and not mistakenly assume that the forms of
collectivity in the crisis represent the whole social picture, I would
like to believe the diverse forms of resistance towards censorship will
be able to maintain and evolve into the future.

## Tejidos Comunitarios Desde los Márgenes: Las Cajas de Resistencia Como Herramienta Autónoma y Autoorganizada en Tiempos de Necesidad (Marta Espuny Contreras) {#tejidos-comunitarios-desde-los-márgenes-las-cajas-de-resistencia-como-herramienta-autónoma-y-autoorganizada-en-tiempos-de-necesidad-marta-espuny-contreras .BOOK_Heading-2}

*In Spain, the COVID-19 pandemic has multiplied networks of mutual
support and solidarity, such as "resistance funds" (e.g., solidarity
pantries). These collective initiatives are a type of digital activism
grounded in practices of horizontal resistance that originated on social
media platforms. What possibilities of autonomy and resistance are
activated within these platforms? What do movements achieve by using
digital social networks?*

Las respuestas colectivas como redes de apoyo mutuo y solidaridad y, en
concreto, las cajas de resistencia (despensas solidarias, fondos de
emergencia, etc.) se han multiplicado a raíz de la pandemia del
COVID-19. Se trata de un tipo de activismo digital, unas prácticas de
resistencia centradas en el apoyo colectivo y la solidaridad comunal que
se han venido desarrollando especialmente en redes sociales.

En este texto se plantea una reflexión crítica sobre los conflictos y
contradicciones que derivan del uso de redes centralizadas -como
Instagram o Facebook- para la creación y coordinación de redes
autónomas, basándonos en las siguientes preguntas: ¿qué posibilidades
autónomas de resistencia se activan dentro de estas plataformas?, ¿qué
consiguen estos movimientos al hacer uso de las redes sociales?
Hablaremos de la fragmentación que sufre el activismo en redes sociales,
y cómo las redes estudiadas superan esa centralización e
individualización mediante la localidad, es decir, anteponiendo el
sentimiento de pertenencia y responsabilidad mutua que diseña un
acuerpamiento y una lucha desde la identidad. Esta localidad,
adelantamos, necesita ser reconfigurada pues ya no se lee con relación a
un espacio compartido sino a una identidad común.

### Vulnerabilidad Social, Exclusión y Redes Comunitarias: Instagram como Objeto Político {#vulnerabilidad-social-exclusión-y-redes-comunitarias-instagram-como-objeto-político .BOOK_Heading-3}

La actual pandemia ha puesto en evidencia las numerosas deficiencias de
nuestras no tan bien consolidadas democracias europeas. Las redes de
apoyo mutuo surgían como única alternativa válida de supervivencia para
los sectores de la sociedad denominados por Sousa Santos como
no-existentes; personas y poblaciones que, por su procedencia[^538],
falta de regulación laboral, identidad de género, profesión[^539]---o
todo lo anterior, permanecen invisibles en los márgenes y no cuentan con
el reconocimiento necesario para beneficiarse de las medidas
gubernamentales. Una precariedad que aumenta con la imposibilidad de
trabajar durante el periodo de confinamiento (o, en algunos casos como
los temporeros de Lleida, incluso trabajando).[^540]

Es en este contexto el que surge la necesidad para estos colectivos de
repensar sus mecanismos de supervivencia, de crear redes de solidaridad,
cuidados colectivos y apoyo mutuo, frente a los paradigmas
individualistas occidentales. Estas acciones se presentan como la única
alternativa simbólica y material de los colectivos de no-existentes. La
construcción autónoma de estos espacios-red es una forma disidente de
establecer relaciones de apoyo en las que sus integrantes pasan de ser
víctimas -de un sistema, unas jerarquías, una pandemia, de la
imposibilidad de adquirir lo mínimo para vivir- a agentes activos,
apropiándose del centro de acción y decisión. Cuando estas redes de
colaboración se expanden hacia las plataformas digitales, encontramos
muchos perfiles que se caracterizan por su gran conciencia identitaria
en relación con las exclusiones y procesos de discriminación nombrados
con anterioridad.

Desde la Teoría de Medios (STS) las plataformas se entienden como
espacios de mediación, que responden a intereses empresariales y
económicos -capitalización de datos, captación de la atención-, por lo
que no son elementos neutros, sino que están al servicio del sistema. Es
en esta mediación y la estandarización -influencia del diseño de la
plataforma- donde reside la clave a la hora de entender las
posibilidades de inter(acción) que ofrecen estas plataformas a los
diferentes actores que la transitan.

Los discursos políticos y activistas se expanden hacia lo digital, donde
se fragmentan y estandarizan por la mediación de estas plataformas,
quedando reducidos a imágenes, slogans o pequeños textos a pie de foto.
En un contexto dominado por la economía de la atención, se publican
consignas agresivas y provocadoras, con una aparentemente alta carga
política, buscando generar un mayor impacto y destacar entre la
sobresaturación de información. Sin embargo, estos mensajes no pueden
presentarse de manera articulada, puesto que las redes sociales no
ofrecen la posibilidad de extender los discursos, no dan lugar a que se
dibuje un hilo conductor de las reivindicaciones.

Transformando sus narrativas al formato Instagram, las luchas políticas
quedan condicionadas por la búsqueda del impacto y la atención. De esta
lógica surge la mediada visibilidad, que produce que ciertos perfiles
cuenten con mayor visibilidad, mientras que otros perfiles queden
aislados en sus comunidades de afines. Esta invisibilización de
determinados perfiles hace de Instagram una herramienta de censura y no
de amplificación. Las redes y plataformas de comunicación tecnológicas
suponen, en este sentido, una amenaza para la emancipación de
movimientos autónomos. Entonces, retomando nuestra pregunta inicial,
cabe cuestionarse ¿qué posibilidades autónomas de resistencia se activan
dentro de estas plataformas?.

Para indagar en las posibilidades autónomas que se movilizan dentro de
estas plataformas, hemos analizado tres hashtags: \#CajaResistencia,
\#TejidoComunitario y \#SolidaridadComunitaria, desde los cuales se ha
realizado un muestreo en cadena hasta identificar un total de 40
perfiles (principio de saturación discursiva). Perfiles gestionados por
personas o colectivos migrantes o que practiquen un trabajo no regulado,
como la venta ambulante, el trabajo sexual, recogida de fruta, etc.,
establecidos en el Estado Español, y que publicaron llamados a
participar en cajas de resistencia durante el confinamiento por COVID-19
en España.

### Activismo y Localidad {#activismo-y-localidad .BOOK_Heading-3}

Los efectos de la estructura, los límites e intereses de las plataformas
recaen sobre sus interacciones. Es desde este punto que estos colectivos
tienen la necesidad de utilizar las affordances de estos medios para
realizar apropiaciones concretas que les permitan la acción. Con
relación a las cajas de resistencia hemos percibido cómo estos
colectivos, consciente o inconscientemente, ponen el foco en la
localidad y en los cuidados. Es decir, superan la fragmentación,
centralización e individualización de las redes gracias a que anteponen
la localidad, a que se priorizan los lazos comunitarios que hacen de
nexo entre diferentes colectividades.

Desde esta perspectiva, resulta necesaria una reconfiguración del
término localidad, que pasa de lo físico a lo simbólico, de lo material
a lo identitario. Ya no implica necesariamente que se comparta un mismo
espacio, sino más bien que se lea a la otra persona como parte del
propio grupo de pertenencia. Entendiendo el grupo como las personas
tienen un mismo origen, que combaten dentro de las mismas luchas (como
antirracismo, disidencia de género, anticolonialismo, transfeminismo,
etc.), o que comparten objetivos o prioridades comunes, líneas o
espacios de debate, proyectos.

Al publicar (e interesarse por) mensajes y proclamas sobre la misma
lucha, perfiles que podrían no llegarse a conectar nunca, debido a las
limitaciones espaciotemporales, empiezan a interrelacionarse dentro de
los espacios digitales. En la siguiente imagen vemos un ejemplo de cómo
la conciencia identitaria resulta una base, un nexo de localidad que, en
el caso de la ayuda mutua, tienen claras referencias a las comunidades
indígenas que tanta experiencia tienen en este tipo de redes. Reclamos
como "tejido comunitario desde los márgenes" o "abrazamos la solidaridad
comunitaria para la vida digna" representan esa búsqueda de solidaridad,
de acuerpamiento entre iguales. Se subraya la solidaridad como respuesta
de contingencia para hacer frente al capitalismo.

Por otro lado, es fundamental la capacidad de las redes sociales para
escalar esa localidad, para trascender las barreras locales y nacionales
y construir redes de solidaridad globales. Esto se da gracias a la
atemporalidad presente en las redes sociales, entendida como el fenómeno
que facilita la comunicación simultánea desde diferentes zonas
geográficas (lo que Castells denominó "timeless time"), que hace de las
redes un espacio compartido más allá de las limitaciones y barreras de
la comunicación presencial. Partiendo de lo local (punto de partida
necesario para la construcción de redes disidentes), estos espacios
permiten la creación de redes translocales y transnacionales que son, en
definitiva, tecnologías preservación colectiva de la vida.

Subrayar el carácter revolucionario de la generación de redes de apoyo
mutuo. La mera construcción y subsistencia de estas cajas de resistencia
en redes sociales supone una revolución en sí misma, puesto que
demuestra que es posible la existencia desde, por y para los márgenes.
En esta época lo vemos como una medida urgente, de contingencia frente a
la falta de recursos. Sin embargo, la autogestión de tejidos
comunitarios podría extrapolarse como solución frente a la
centralización capitalista. Con respecto a proyectos de emancipación y
autonomía, tenemos mucho que aprender de los paradigmas y estructuras
creadas desde las diásporas, de sus tecnologías ancestrales de
supervivencia. Se trata de un trabajo de descolonización para sustituir
los paradigmas individualistas por proyectos locales y autónomos que
busquen una emancipación colectiva, que rompan con la relación de
co-dependencia generada a través de los años con los estados y el
capital.

## Citizen Sensing and Ontopolitics in the Anthropocene: Engaging with COVID-19 and Climate Change (Marie Petersmann & Anna Berti Suman) {#citizen-sensing-and-ontopolitics-in-the-anthropocene-engaging-with-covid-19-and-climate-change-marie-petersmann-anna-berti-suman .BOOK_Heading-2}

Over the past weeks, a plethora of articles explored the relations[^541]
between the COVID-19 crisis and the climate catastrophe by framing the
former as an opportunity to learn lessons for tackling the latter.[^542]
Among the articles was an essay by Bruno Latour, inviting us to address
the current pandemic as a "dress rehearsal" that incites us to prepare
for climate change.[^543] Elsewhere, Latour argued that the pandemic had
"actually proven that it is possible, in a few weeks, to put an economic
system on hold everywhere in the world and at the same time, a system
that we were told it was impossible to slow down or redirect."[^544]
Yet, despite the fact that both events constitute globally shared
"collective" experiences, immediate societal responses to them vary
greatly. While both events have their causes and effects entwined, their
different spatio-temporal scales and socio-ecological implications make
socio-political responses to them difficult to compare. Of course, this
is not to say that links between the two events do not exist. The
outbreak of the zoonotic[^545] COVID-19 is entangled with multiple[^546]
and often interacting "threats to ecosystems and wildlife, including
habitat loss, illegal trade, pollution, invasive species and,
increasingly, climate change."[^547]

### Impacts {#impacts .BOOK_Heading-3}

On a positive note, we observed a widely shared enthusiasm among the
climate scientific community when the measurements[^548] of the European
Copernicus agency registered an unusual drop in nitrogen dioxide levels
in February 2020, as analysed by NASA's ground observation team.
COVID-19 is indeed set to have caused the "largest ever annual fall in
CO~2~ emissions",[^549] more than during any previous economic crisis or
period of war. Studies[^550] also showed, inversely, that low levels of
air pollution may be a way to prevent COVID-19 deaths.[^551] Finally,
the plunging demand for oil wrought by the COVID-19 was said to have
permanently altered the course of the climate catastrophe.[^552] As a
result, after 2019 being coined "the year of climate
consciousness"[^553] with a "growing momentum"[^554] for climate
activism, the current drop of atmospheric pollution was welcomed by
many.

Caution[^555] was, however, voiced by those who pleaded for more
nuance[^556], and requested we refrain from granting agency to the virus
itself, pointing instead to the temporary retreat from capitalism's
"industrial production and its handmaidens" to explain the current low
emissions.[^557] Although praised by many as a "catalyst for
transformation"[^558] that brings about "an unprecedented opportunity to
rethink how our beliefs, values, and institutions shape our
relationships"[^559], on the long run, the economic crisis triggered by
COVID-19 may well lead to a suspension of adopted and prospective
climate measures.[^560] Circular economists and de-growth advocates also
pointed to the short-term risks that the pandemic may have triggered by
increasing the use of private transportation means and the consumption
of single-use plastic products.[^561] This has led cities such as
Amsterdam to pro-actively consider the "doughnut" model to mend the
post-COVID-19 economy[^562], bearing in mind that "calls for solidarity
with the weak and disadvantaged must be part and parcel of \[such\]
shifts."[^563]

Even in a world that has come to a halt, we still fall short of the
emission targets needed to keep global warming from surpassing 1.5
degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. Our failure shows
the structural and systemic[^564] deficiencies we need to deal with and
signals "how much further there is to go."[^565]

### Towards Sensing Engagement {#towards-sensing-engagement .BOOK_Heading-3}

Whether or not the COVID-19 crisis will be beneficial for tackling
climate change in the long run (beyond the immediate drop in atmospheric
pollution) remains a question open to debate.[^566] The outcome will
depend on the political will of states, corporations, and citizens. Our
purpose here is not to add one more proposal to the existing menu of
policy goals for the post-COVID-19 time to come. Neither do we wish to
celebrate the environmental impact of the corona crisis, which feels
inappropriate at a time when so many are suffering from the disease and
its related harms; dead relatives could not be buried[^567], bodies have
decomposed in trucks for overflow storage in funeral homes[^568],
unprecedented unemployment rates exist[^569], and queues[^570] before
food banks and unaffordable medical bills are soaring.[^571]

Instead, our objective is to explore how the turn to sensing---as a
distinctive mode of engagement with socio-ecological issues---can
productively re-imagine and address ongoing events such as the COVID-19
and climate change. In line with Fleur Johns, "\[s\]ensing, in this
context, refers to the work of eliciting, receiving, and processing
impressions and information, both in the mode of intuitions or feelings,
and in terms of data." Sensing, then "includes all bodily faculties of
perception, but is not restricted to corporeal sensation, individual or
collective." Sensing, as such, "is never just about the body, as
distinct from the mind".[^572]

In the next section, we start by theoretically defining and elaborating
on the potential of sensing as a way to cope with events like the
current pandemic and climate change, which demand a different
configuration of existence. We see the turn to sensing as a response to
Donna Haraway's invitation to "stay with the trouble" of living and
dying together on a damaged earth.[^573] We percieve her suggestion as
more conducive to thinking that would provide a means to build more
liveable futures. We then turn to specific examples of "citizen sensing"
initiatives and conclude by questioning how the insights drawn from such
"sensing practices" can fruitfully cope with the risks associated with
the pandemic and climate change.[^574]

### Sensing the Unknown {#sensing-the-unknown .BOOK_Heading-3}

Both COVID-19 and climate change are examples of "hyperobjects"---a term
coined by philosopher Timothy Morton to refer to entities that are so
massively distributed in space and time that they defy not only our
understanding, but also our control.[^575] COVID-19 cannot be seen, yet
its latent presence is felt everywhere. In the pandemic, COVID-19 cannot
be contained nor controlled, only its effects can be *mitigated* through
specific guidelines[^576] and physical distancing[^577], a survival tool
revealing inequalities spanning class[^578], gender[^579], race[^580]
and mental health.[^581] Similarly, climate change affects us all
unequally[^582], despite it being "almost impossible for changes in
climate to be perceived through individual experience".[^583] Both
COVID-19 and climate change share the characteristics that Morton
ascribes to hyperobjects.[^584] They are "viscous" (they "stick" to us),
"nonlocal" (their overall effects are globally distributed across space
and time), "phased" (we can only experience local manifestations of them
at any one time and place), and "inter-objective" (they are intertwined
with other objects to which they cannot be reduced). Their reality and
existence challenge human perception and imagination. Hyperobjects
remain, in other words, elusive and invisible, although their reality is
unquestionable. Even as they defy immediate and unmediated human
experience, we can sense their omnipresence.

Against this backdrop, speculative approaches dispense with necessary
phenomenological correlations between knowledge and first-person
experience, and recognize the limits of human thought and imagination to
relate to things that humans do not perceive directly.[^585] They
instead invite us to empathically relate to such events and sense their
effects, even without unmediated access to them. While the realm of
experience[^586] is limited to actual observations and the process of
learning by practical trial or proof, the definition of sense[^587]
alludes to the faculty of perception \[and\] feeling. As such, it refers
both to the detection of certain parameters and the emotions associated
with what is revealed. Seen through this prism, sensing aspires to
emotionally relate to the distress caused by certain events, whether the
harm directly or only indirectly impacts us as human beings. In other
words, sense is an invitation to engage creatively, imaginatively, and
speculatively with events beyond immediate human representation and
experience. As Morton puts it, the mere fact of thinking their existence
or sensing their effects requires us to care about such
hyperobjects.[^588]

### Governments {#governments .BOOK_Heading-3}

From a governance perspective, a number of studies have showed how a
turn to sensing can be productive to re-envisage political perspectives
and legal approaches to reconsider the more-than-human world we inhabit.
As elaborated by David Chandler, sensing as a form of governance is
based on correlation rather than causation, and depends on the
disposition to "see things in their process of emergence or in real
time".[^589] Sensing through new technologies can play a decisive role
in environmental politics, by inspiring awareness and mobilizing
publics. These forms of "material participation" can facilitate the
capacity to detect the effects of relational interactions and cast them
as either problems or possibilities.[^590] As such, biosensory
techniques can make imperceptible harms perceptible, knowable and
measurable. They can even permit "a growing awareness of planetary
life".[^591]

The effects of interactions between entities are rendered perceptible
through forms of correlational sight, thereby enabling "new forms of
(datafied) relational awareness".[^592] At a local level, the use of
sensory technologies by individuals and communities allows for
grassroots, bottom-up, and auto-empowering engagement with threats. Such
engagements empower citizens by shifting the infrastructures,
technologies, and practices of monitoring to less institutionalised
arrangements.[^593] From this perspective, "sensing citizens" are seen
as part of "material-political arrangements and struggles over who
generates, legitimizes, and has authority over data and how data is
mobilized to make claims for environmental and other rights".[^594] With
the burgeoning trend towards a "digitalization of mainstream
environmental and climate governance",[^595] technology plays a key role
in the constitution of socio-ecological assemblages, and promotes a
novel ontology that changes the very nature of liberal governance.[^596]

Citizens using sensing technologies are thereby recast as a
"geo-socially networked community of sensors".[^597] As such, they are
able to "make visible politically masked risks"[^598] and reclaim their
agency by shaping responses to the socio-ecological issues at stake. In
the next section, we will explore how forms of "citizen sensing" can
facilitate individuals and communities who are sensitive to the
material, interdependent world they are part of, and act as proactive
agents in their own governance.

### Citizen Sensing: From Sensing Radiations to COVID-19 {#citizen-sensing-from-sensing-radiations-to-covid-19 .BOOK_Heading-3}

In the immediate aftermath of the disastrous earthquake and tsunami that
struck eastern Japan on March 11, 2011 and the subsequent meltdown of
the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant, accurate and trustworthy
radiation information was publicly unavailable.

Against this backdrop, a volunteer-driven non-profit organization
called Safecast was formed to enable individuals "to monitor, collect
and openly share radiation measurements"[^599] and other data on
radiation levels. The initiative "mobilized individuals and
collectives"[^600] in response to risks that were perceived as extremely
urgent to monitor, namely the post-Fukushima radiation levels. Safecast
can thus be regarded as a shock-driven initiative that constitutes a
"successful \[example of\] citizen \[sensing\] for radiation measurement
and communication after Fukushima."[^601] As the Safecast initiative
grew in size, scope, and geographical reach, their mission soon expanded
to provide citizens worldwide with the tools to inform themselves by
gathering and sharing accurate environmental data in an open and
participatory fashion. Through a form of auto-empowerment, Safecast
participants were able to monitor their own homes and environments,
thereby "free\[ing\] themselves of dependence on government and other
institutions for this kind of essential information." As described on
Safecast's website, this process gave rise to "technically competent
citizen science efforts worldwide."

### Reaction {#reaction .BOOK_Heading-3}

Following the outbreak of COVID-19, the Safecast collective rapidly
responded to the virus by setting up an information platform on the
evolution of the crisis and a map of COVID-19 testing[^602] that
provides a picture of where to obtain testing options. Over the years,
Safecast had accumulated much experience and insights on "trust, crisis
communication, public perception, and what happens when people feel
threatened by a lack of reliable information."[^603] Yet, the Safecast
collective still struggles to be heard and "many scientists ignore their
data."[^604] Despite this scarce official recognition, Safecast took
advantage of its experience and societal impact to rapidly respond to
the current pandemic.

As observed by Safecast volunteers, "\[w\]e find ourselves again trying
to better understand what is happening." In a webinar on "Lessons we are
learning from the COVID-19 pandemic for radiological risk
communication", Azby Brown---a volunteer at Safecast and director of the
Kanazawa Institute of Technology's Future Design Institute in
Tokyo---drew several links between the nature of ionising radiations and
COVID-19. By alluding to the invisible presence and constant risks posed
by such hyperobjects, the invitation to the webinar started by stating
that "\[y\]ou can't see, smell, or taste it, but it may be a problem,"
which applies equally to radiations as well as viruses. Elsewhere, Brown
observed that:

Fear of the unknown is normal, and radiation and viruses are both
invisible threats that heighten anxiety. Most people have almost no way
to determine for themselves whether they have come into contact with
either of these threats, and they find themselves dependent on
specialists, testing devices, and government and media reports. If the
government and media do not provide clear, credible explanations and
prompt communications, misinformation and mistrust can easily take root
and spread.[^605]

For Brown, Safecast's risk communication perspective was relevant in the
current COVID-19 context because the collective gained experience after
the Fukushima disaster. Despite major differences between ionising
radiations and COVID-19, similarities in risks communications are worth
exploring.

Analogous governmental failures on risk communication were observed
regarding shortcomings in rapidly conveying clear messages to the public
and communicating strategies based on non-conflicting expert and policy
opinions. The ambiguous and incomplete information received from the
authorities generated a sense of uncertainty and distrust for many
citizens dependent on single sources of official information. Against
this backdrop, initiatives such as Safecast that enabled people to
control and monitor the presence and degrees of certain risks provided
an alternative source of credible crowdsourced information. Beyond the
immediate informational benefit for sensing citizens, such tools could
further enable holding governments and officials to account.

### A Global Phenomenon {#a-global-phenomenon .BOOK_Heading-3}

At the time of writing, citizen sensing initiatives tackling COVID-19
are multiplying around the world, as listed by the Australian Citizen
Science Association[^606], and COVID-19 Italia Help.[^607] Such citizen
sensing practices "constitute ways of expressing care about
environments, communities and individual and public health".[^608] As
argued by Gabrys, these practices "are not just ways of documenting the
presence of \[threats\]," they are also "techniques for tuning sensation
and feeling environments through different experiential registers".
Granular monitoring by sensing citizens is particularly valuable in
times of emergencies, when governments are faced with urgent, massive
and systemic risks of spatial and temporal scales that defy immediate
control---such as the current pandemic.

Civic "sentries"[^609] can offer relief to affected people through
solidarity networks and provide resources to policy-makers and
scientists through wider access to grassroots-driven and information.
Citizen sensing initiatives also enable lay people, turned into "sensing
citizens," to retain a greater degree of agency over the production and
use of the data assembled. Against the ever-increasing rise of
"bio-surveillance states"[^610] and the development of
"symptoms-tracking"[^611] and "contact-tracing"[^612] apps, "bottom-up
innovations"[^613] might help counter the acceleration of digital
surveillance[^614] that may be hard to scale back[^615] after the
pandemic.

Open-access data on citizens' sensing may be considered more transparent
and trustworthy by the public, and convey important information on
widely shared, lived experiences. By making data about real but
invisible threats available through the intermediary of sensing
citizens, access to information and agency in knowledge production is
redistributed. Finally, the increased "(datafied) relational awareness"
and "forms of correlational sight" that are produced can create new
appreciations of the connections between human and non-human coexisting
lifeforms.[^616]

### Concluding Thoughts {#concluding-thoughts .BOOK_Heading-3}

As hyperobjects, both COVID-19 and climate change defy not only
our understanding but also our control.[^617] Their causes and effects
are so massively dispersed across space and time that they evade
unmediated appearance. The impacts of hyperobjects operate through forms
of 'slow violence"[^618], which are "often attritional, disguised, and
temporally latent, making the articulation of slow violence a
representational challenge".[^619] Only partial, local and deferred
manifestations can be captured through experience. Our way of relating
and responding to such hyperobjects depends on temporal, spatial and
emotional predicaments. The more temporally-immediate,
spatially-proximate and emotionally-tangible hyperobjects are, the
greater and quicker our responses tend to be. Temporal, spatial, and
emotional scales are central to our ability to sense the presence of
invisible threats such as viruses and changes in the climate.

While socio-ecological threats posed by climate change have been present
for decades, responses remained relatively marginal in light of the
risks at stake. Conversely, while the health threats posed by the
COVID-19 are relatively shorter-term, these risks triggered immediate
and radical responses. The fact that the COVID-19 is sensed as a direct
risk to individuals or vulnerable relatives prompts instant reactions.
The sensed temporal and spatial proximity of the invisible threat brings
us to important questions.

The current pandemic brought to light what climate activists deplored
for so long, namely that we tend to care more for risks posed to our
individual than collective conditions. A sense of emotional distance is
generated by spatial and temporal gaps. This self-centred sentiment is
reinforced by an anthropocentric appraisal that limits our ethics of
care[^620] to the sole concern for the human species, instead of
striving to "support the flourishing of other animals and natural
things"[^621] with which we are intrinsically entangled. While
pessimistic projections[^622] on climate change have often been framed
as triggering a sense of denial, paralysis or aporia, the current
pandemic shows how emotions such as fear, anxiety, and dread[^623] can
also lead to mobilization, collective concern, and action.

Emotions are, ultimately, about social movement; the root of the word
"emotion" is the Latin *emovere*, which implies both movement and
agitation.[^624] Despite the risks of strategic exploitation of fear or
despair by political actors instrumentalizing a "state of
exception",[^625] such emotions can unleash an enhanced sense of
solidarity and cohesion through increased awareness of our fragile state
of coexistence and new forms of collective attachment.[^626] This is
true at the human level and at a "more-than-human" level, by inviting
people to be alert and attentive to humans' impact on and
interdependence with the natural world we are part of. Such
sensibilities can even give rise to a sense of cross-species shared
vulnerability, where hope and grief[^627] enable us to re-envision
different forms of "collaborative survival".[^628]

In this chapter, we modestly explored how citizen sensing initiatives
can help bridge the temporal, spatial, and emotional distance between
human (re)actions. They can present yet-invisible threats through
self-production of independent knowledge and agency. As Gabrys reminds
us:

These practices are not just ways to rework the data and evidence that
might be brought to bear on environmental problems. They are also ways
of creating sensing entities, relations, and politics, which come
together through particular ways of making sense of environmental
problems.[^629]

We argue that, by recasting the actants and subjectivities involved, the
technological and data-based sensors used by "sensing citizens" have a
world-making effect by facilitating awareness and intelligibility of
certain threats. Physical isolation being implemented globally doesn't
mean that we need to feel isolated and powerless. Daily citizen science
involves re-imagining scales and the potential of working together to
provide a sense of connection and purpose.[^630] In reconfiguring the
"distribution of the sensible"[^631]---a "system of self-evident facts
of sense perception that simultaneously discloses the existence of
something in common and the delimitations that define the respective
parts and positions within it"[^632]---new avenues are opened up for
citizens to foresee, understand, visualize threats, and (ac)count for
the damages caused.[^633]

Beyond the realm of immediate perception and reactions, decentralized,
grassroots-driven, and cooperative sensing technologies may also
redistribute agency to challenge more official monitoring
infrastructures, and galvanize appropriate political responses.
Politics, ultimately, ["]{dir="rtl"}revolves around what is seen and
what can be said about it, around who has the ability to see and the
talent to speak, around the properties of spaces and the possibilities
of time".[^634] These configurations of the sensible, we argue, map an
important terrain for rethinking the politics of hyperobjects such as
COVID-19 and climate change.

## Liberating COVID-19 Data with Volunteers in Brazil (Peter Füssy) {#liberating-covid-19-data-with-volunteers-in-brazil-peter-füssy .BOOK_Heading-2}

While healthcare workers fight the coronavirus pandemic with drugs and
ventilators, journalists and data activists try to tackle the
["]{dir="rtl"}infodemic" with numbers and visualizations. In Brazil, it
is difficult to tell who is winning those battles, as the death toll
continues to rise. President Jair Bolsonaro ["]{dir="rtl"}continues to
sow confusion by openly flouting and discouraging the sensible measures
of physical distancing and lockdown," according to an editorial from the
journal *The Lancet*.[^635] Mixing a historical lack of capacity with an
attempt to control the narrative of the crisis, the federal government
has provided poor quality numbers about COVID-19, reinforcing how data
["]{dir="rtl"}can also shape perceived realities," as Renzi and Langlois
claim.[^636]

As a result of federal administration decisions, Brazil is one of the
countries that test less for the virus.[^637] It also has a peculiar
COVID-19 dashboard that shows the number of recovered cases with larger
font sizes, then new cases and deaths with smaller fonts.[^638] For one
week in June 2020, the total toll of cases and deaths was completely
removed from the dashboard, only to reappear after intense criticism.
The Brazilian government also cancelled the daily press conferences and
started to release pandemic reports to the most-watched TV news program
in the country. All of these decisions were seen by the media[^639] and
independent organizations as authoritarian, insensitive attempts to make
COVID-19 deaths invisible.[^640]

\[Picture 1\]

Brazil[']{dir="rtl"}s Ministry of Health dashboard highlights recovered
cases estimation (Source: covid.saude.gov.br)

The Ministry of Health provides numbers only by states (in Brazil, one
state can be as large as France, Spain and Sweden combined), which means
that the local dimensions of the problem are mostly ignored. The
government had promised information by cities but never delivered and,
to make the data worse, switched the report format from an open format
(CSV) to a closed one (Microsoft Excel) in the middle of the pandemic.
As I discussed previously, Bolsonaro has been limiting access to
information since the beginning of his regime.[^641] The institutional
resistance to transparency has only become more evident with the health
crisis.[^642]

During the pandemic, data activism has assumed governmental functions,
providing numbers to substantiate decisions on a variety of levels, from
NGOs (1,[^643] 2[^644]) to policymakers (1[^645], 2[^646]), which use
open data from activist group Brasil.IO.[^647] Trying to reduce
the ["]{dir="rtl"}data gap"[^648] characteristic of countries of the
Global South, data activists and other civil society organizations are
collecting and structuring COVID-19 data. Besides Brasil.IO, journalists
from six major newspapers and news portals[^649] are working together to
provide independent total numbers of COVID-19 deaths and confirmed
cases, while a data intelligence consultant[^650] is crowdfunding
another COVID-19 monitor. Initiatives like these work with primary
sources, allowing news production and research to be less dependent on
problematic federal reports.

In the case of Brazil, more than making people visible and represented
through the concept of data justice or advocating for social change,
data activism is essential to challenge the state narrative about the
pandemic and prevent more deaths from COVID-19. If Brazilian democracy
depends on data activism and data journalism, it will not die in the
dark.

### Brasil.IO Case {#brasil.io-case .BOOK_Heading-3}

One group of volunteers taking over the Brazilian
government[']{dir="rtl"}s responsibilities is the Brasil.IO initiative.
Their COVID-19 project includes data from more than 5.500 municipalities
and other sources, such as notaries. This data has been used by major
newspapers and news broadcasters, including The New York
Times,[^651] CNN[^652] and The BBC.[^653] Scientific research is also
relying on their data to produce comparative
studies[^654] and forecasting.[^655] Figures from Brasil.IO indicate not
only underreporting, but also a delay in delivering the official totals
of COVID-19 deaths. For instance, the Ministry of Health announced that
the country had reached a thousand deaths on April 11, while
Brasil.IO[']{dir="rtl"}s platform reached the same number six days
earlier. If undercounting promotes a discourse that minimizes the health
crisis, data activism can liberate the true numbers for public scrutiny.

## 

### Social Media Call and Operationalization {#social-media-call-and-operationalization .BOOK_Heading-3}

Seeing the lack of structured data about COVID-19, Álvaro Justen,
founder of the non-profit organization Brasil.IO, tweeted a call for
volunteers to help with collecting data manually from all the 27
federative units on March 20. Rapidly, 34 volunteers answered the tweet,
mostly data journalists and software developers.
["]{dir="rtl"}Fortunately, I have several friends and contacts who work
with journalism and data and it was not difficult to find volunteers,"
said Justen in an interview I conducted with him over email.

The group spent one whole weekend manually tabulating hundreds of
epidemiological bulletins from state health departments since the
beginning of the pandemic. Because of the urgency, they started by using
Google Spreadsheets to consolidate data. After the first round, the
spreadsheets with the most recent numbers started to feed directly into
the reformulated Brasil.IO platform, which uses Python, Django and
PostgreSQL. All communication is made through an open-source chat
platform (Rocket.Chat), while publicization of updates and new insights
appear on Twitter and in a Telegram group. Scripts for automated
processes such as scraping data, monitoring data, checking data,
generating internal reports, and consolidating data are available
at GitHub.[^656] For example, the group uses a robot to send
notifications to the chat when one State Health Secretariat updates
COVID-19 numbers.

##  {#section-28 .BOOK_Heading-2}

### Improving Data Quality {#improving-data-quality .BOOK_Heading-3}

Due to the issues with data quality, much of the data is collected
manually by volunteers. Besides collecting and checking data, volunteers
also contact health secretariats to recommend good data practices and
ask them to make changes, so the data is more accessible through
automated processes. ["]{dir="rtl"}Not all respond satisfactorily but
most of them are willing to collaborate in some way. With time and
pressure, some things are improving but not in speed that a pandemic
requires," Justen points out.

In order to create an open data culture in Brazil, Justen has worked to
improve databases and tools to facilitate data extraction from
inaccessible formats since 2013. One emblematic example is a dataset
that includes more than 500 thousand companies and their shareholders
registered at the Brazilian Internal Revenue Service (Receita Federal).
After the 2011 Freedom of Information (FOI) act, that information should
be publicly available to automated collection. However, the page hosting
the data uses captchas to limit access. After several FOI requests in
2018, their request was denied with a link to a system that sold the
data for R\$ 506,000. Justen and other data activists then pressured the
IRS, which finally sent the dataset in a USB drive.

As everything is done on a voluntary basis and the data are available
free of charge for everyone, one of the challenges of the project is
locating financial funding. ["]{dir="rtl"}We don[']{dir="rtl"}t have
that much time to work on the project and therefore not everything
advances at the speed we would like," says Justen. To help with this
issue, they started a crowdfunding campaign[^657] to hire developers,
making it possible to add new datasets that can be useful to
["]{dir="rtl"}flatten the curve" of coronavirus in Brazil.
Brasil.IO[']{dir="rtl"}s manifesto[^658] defines the process of
collecting, converting, cleaning, and making data available in a
structured and open format as ["]{dir="rtl"}data liberation." As stated
in the manifesto, ["]{dir="rtl"}liberating" access to public data is to
make democracy less elitist. However, during the exceptional
circumstances of the COVID-19 response in Brazil, liberating data is
fundamental to ensure democracy and save lives.

## La Marcha Digital de las Madres de los Desaparecidos en México (Thomas Aureliani)  {#la-marcha-digital-de-las-madres-de-los-desaparecidos-en-méxico-thomas-aureliani .BOOK_Heading-2}

*Mother*[']{dir="rtl"}*s Day is the symbolic anniversary of the
disappearance of Mexican youth at the hands of drug cartels. On this
day, their mothers---known as desaparecidos---protest by showing their
anger and pain to institutions and the media. This chapter explores
their efforts to reaffirm a need for justice during the coronavirus
pandemic, and protesting while social distancing.*

La propagación del COVID-19 y las medidas restrictivas implementadas por
los gobiernos de todo el mundo están teniendo un fuerte impacto en las
formas de movilización. En México, las medidas de distanciamiento social
y la interrupción de muchas actividades consideradas no esenciales están
impidiendo que muchos familiares de desaparecidos salgan a buscar a sus
seres queridos y a expresar públicamente su ira y dolor. Además, la
cuarentena parece haber causado una disminución del trabajo, ya muy
retrasado e ineficaz, de las instituciones encargadas de desarrollar las
investigaciones y de la búsqueda de los más de 61 mil desaparecidos
reconocidos oficialmente por el gobierno de Andrés Manuel López Obrador.
De hecho, el país está experimentando una crisis humanitaria sin
precedentes debido a la llamada ["]{dir="rtl"}Guerra contra el
Narcotráfico", inaugurada por el expresidente Felipe Calderón Hinojosa
(2006-2012) y continuada por el gobierno de Enrique Peña Nieto
(2012-2018). La violencia vinculada a la militarización de la seguridad
pública, el narcotráfico y los enfrentamientos por el control de
territorios ricos en recursos estratégicos han despoblado enteras
regiones de México. Muchos de estos territorios están sujetos al poder
de las organizaciones criminales paramilitares que operan de forma
autónoma o con la colaboración de las instituciones estatales,
exacerbando los niveles endémicos de corrupción e impunidad que ya
caracterizaban al país latinoamericano. Estos conflictos han causado más
de 250 mil asesinatos en 12 años y una serie de violaciones de los
derechos humanos, como por ejemplo las ejecuciones extrajudiciales,
torturas y, de hecho, desapariciones. Estas últimas son perpetradas por
agentes estatales y organizaciones criminales, y las víctimas pueden ser
personas con o sin alguna militancia social o política, sospechosos por
cualquier circunstancia o señalados por funcionarios públicos de los
diferentes gobiernos de pertenecer a bandas del crimen organizado. Las
desapariciones pueden afectar indistintamente a hombres y mujeres, niños
y niñas, personas indígenas, campesinas, estudiantes, migrantes,
defensores y defensoras de los derechos humanos, e incluso funcionarios
estatales.

### Resistencia Civil {#resistencia-civil .BOOK_Heading-3}

En respuesta a este contexto de violencia se han desarrollado diferentes
formas de resistencia civil, movimientos, asociaciones y redes dedicadas
a la defensa de los derechos humanos de las víctimas y de sus
familiares. El 10 de mayo de 2012, el Día de la Madre, colectivos de
familiares y organizaciones civiles del Noreste del país convocaron por
primera vez la ["]{dir="rtl"}Marcha de la Dignidad Nacional, Madres
buscando a sus hijos e hijas y buscando justicia", que se convirtió en
el evento colectivo más importante para los familiares de los
desaparecidos, especialmente para las madres. Año tras año, más y más
madres, padres, hermanas, hermanos, hijos e hijas, abuelos y abuelas se
han unido a esta marcha. Se han agregado también los comités y
asociaciones de familiares de los desaparecidos de la
["]{dir="rtl"}Guerra Sucia" de los años [']{dir="rtl"}60
-[']{dir="rtl"}70 -[']{dir="rtl"}80, décadas en las que el estado
autoritario mexicano hizo desaparecer a los activistas políticos,
estudiantes y trabajadores que se oponían al régimen. Pero no solo eso:
cientos de asociaciones, ONG y organizaciones internacionales dedicadas
a la protección de los derechos humanos como Amnistía Internacional, la
asociación italiana antimafia ["]{dir="rtl"}Libera", la Cruz Roja
Internacional o la Oficina del Alto Comisionado de las Naciones Unidas
para los Derechos Humanos cada año se unen a las voces de las madres.

El impacto simbólico del evento es muy fuerte: las madres se reúnen y
manifiestan que el 10 de mayo no hay nada que celebrar. Los 10 de mayo
ellas desfilan con fotos de sus desaparecidos impresas en las playeras o
en grandes pancartas. La gran mayoría de las madres todavía no ha
encontrado a sus seres queridos y esperan tanto la verdad como la
justicia y la reparación integral de los daños causados por la
desaparición de sus hijos y hijas. Muchas madres sufren por la
cuarentena porque no pueden salir, armadas con palas y rastrillos, a
excavar en los territorios donde suelen encontrar fosas clandestinas y
donde se supone que hay miles de cuerpos abandonados o restos humanos.
No pueden seguir presionando a los órganos de gobierno y justicia, no
pueden participar en las reuniones, conferencias, cursos de capacitación
para aprender cómo buscar. Y sufren porque este año la Marcha no se ha
podido organizar.

Por este motivo, el Movimiento por Nuestros Desaparecidos en México ha
organizado una gran movilización digital durante la pandemia. Cabe
señalar que el Movimiento se creó en marzo de 2015 con el propósito de
redactar la la primera Ley General en materia de desapariciones en
México, y hoy reúne a cientos de colectivos de familiares y
organizaciones civiles que luchan por la correcta implementación de la
misma Ley (las historias y actividades de estos colectivos, así como las
noticias sobre el Movimiento se pueden encontrar en el sitio web).[^659]
Con los años, el Movimiento se ha convertido en el principal referente
nacional sobre el tema de las desapariciones a través de la presión
política y de las manifestaciones públicas.

### Marcha Digital {#marcha-digital .BOOK_Heading-3}

Gracias al apoyo de algunas organizaciones civiles con mayor experiencia
en el campo del activismo digital, el Movimiento ha impulsado muchas
campañas a través de las redes sociales donde exige búsqueda efectiva de
los desaparecidos, verdad, justicia y no repetición de los hechos
criminales. Una de las primeras y más simbólicas campañas fue el
lanzamiento del hashtag \#SinLasFamiliasNo, que tenía el propósito de
señalar la necesidad de involucrar a los familiares de víctimas en los
procesos de redacción y implementación de la Ley a nivel federal y
local. La participación activa de ellos siempre ha sido una piedra
angular del Movimiento: muchos familiares se han convertido en
activistas y defensores de los derechos humanos reconocidos a nivel
nacional e internacional.

Este año la Marcha se ha desarrollado necesariamente en forma digital
con el objetivo de ["]{dir="rtl"}tomar las redes sociales", igual que
las calles y las plazas durante todos estos años de lucha: con dignidad,
fuerza y un amor incansable. Las familias quieren decir que a pesar del
coronavirus no se detiene ni su necesidad de justicia ni la búsqueda de
los desaparecidos. Añaden también que México sigue viviendo una
emergencia humanitaria en la que hay miles de cuerpos no identificados
esperando de ser nombrados y devueltos a sus familiares. En un
comunicado, el Movimiento ha invitado a todas las personas solidarias a
enviar o publicar en redes sociales su propia imagen usando un
cubrebocas con la leyenda: "¿Dónde están?"; videos mensajes o piezas
artísticas utilizando el hashtag \#CorazonesEnMarcha. La movilización
digital tuvo mucho éxito: miles y miles de mensajes, vídeos y fotos
inundaron la red y contribuyeron a sensibilizar la opinión pública y a
visibilizar la tragedia. Las fotos de perfil se actualizaron con el
motivo creado por el Movimiento.

Muchas madres compartieron con orgullo las fotos de sus hijos e hijas
como ocurre cada año. Desde diferentes estados de la República,
publicaciones con fotografías y música producidas por muchos colectivos
se publicaron en Facebook, Twitter e Instagram. Manifestaciones de
solidaridad vinieron también de ciudadanos comunes, mexicanos y
extranjeros, y de organismos internacionales como Amnistía
Internacional, la Oficina del Alto Comisionado de las Naciones Unidas
para los Derechos Humanos, el Comité contra las Desapariciones Forzadas
y el Grupo de Trabajo de la ONU sobre las Desapariciones Forzadas o
Involuntarias. Además, se volvieron virales hashtags como
\#YoApoyoParaEncontrarles, \#HastaEncontrarles, \#NosHacenFalta y
\#10DeMayoNadaQueCelebrar. Esta forma particular de movilización digital
ha demostrado una vez más la fuerza de estos familiares, de las madres
en particular: ellas no se detienen. Ni siquiera el virus más letal
podrá detener sus espíritu de lucha y sus necesidad de justicia. Porque
como ellas siempre dicen: ¡Vivos se los llevaron, vivos los queremos!

## Brazilian Counter-Surveillance Collective Action in a Data-Sensitive era: The Case of \#VidasNegrasImportam (Simone da Silva Ribeiro Gomes)  {#brazilian-counter-surveillance-collective-action-in-a-data-sensitive-era-the-case-of-vidasnegrasimportam-simone-da-silva-ribeiro-gomes .BOOK_Heading-2}

Since early March, 2020, COVID-19 has already taken the lives of more
than 144,767 people in Brazil.[^660] The invisibilities and resistances
of victims of the first pandemic of the datafied society differ greatly
according to race and gender. Protests in Brazil declared
\#VidasNegrasImportam (\#BlackLivesMatter) at this year protests,
spurred by both US anti-racist protests and the coronavirus\'s heavy
toll on Black Brazilians. This racist toll is especially salient when it
comes to Brazil, one of the world's hardest-hit countries where hundreds
die daily. President Jair Bolsonaro has been criticized for his poor
handling of a pandemic that disproportionately affects Black
people---more than half of the countries' population, the result of
structural racism that dates back to slavery.[^661]

This article reflects on how police violence of the datafied society in
plural Global Souths---not limited to the geographical connotation of
the concept---shape protest dynamics, through the example of recent
events in Brazil.[^662] Specifically, I attend to the Black, favela, and
periphery residents marching through Rio de Janeiro on June 7, 2020, in
the \#VidasNegrasImportam (\#BlackLivesMatter) protest against racism.
For the second Sunday in a row, the streets throughout Brazil were
filled by protest for Black Lives, motivated by protests in the US for
George Floyd from late May. The protesters marched in opposition to the
State's policies, in reaction to the intensification of social
vulnerability amid the country's COVID-19 economic and public health
crisis. as well as the unceasing police violence in the favelas during
the pandemic.

The protests unfolded in a city where 80% of people killed by police in
the first half of 2019 were Black, and state violence keeps increasing
in the favelas in the midst of the pandemic.[^663] Protests were called
in response to the murder of Matheus Oliveira, a young Black favela
resident shot by the police while he was returning home. Between January
and June 2020, police in the state of Rio de Janeiro killed 881 people,
about five per day, a significant increase on the last few years; in
2018, 1,534 people were killed by police officers.[^664]

In response, Black, poor, favela, and periphery youth filled downtown
Rio de Janeiro's main avenue, marching despite rumours of police
repression on social media and questions about the merits of risking
COVID-19 infection for an in-person protest in the streets. The police
frisked protestors on their way to the march in pick-up trucks and on
motorcycles, on horseback and on foot. They deployed batons,
rubber-bullet rifles, and gas cannons on intimidate protestors.[^665]
Rio de Janeiro's Military Police also conveyed their orientations in
their Twitter account, asking protestors on their way to the march not
to bring hand sanitizer in quantities larger than 50ml.[^666] However,
there is no municipal or state-level decree restricting the quantity of
hand sanitizer one can carry for personal use. What police forces do is
use this as justification to detain protesters traveling away from the
protest. Police forces in Brazil, Mexico, and other Latin-American
countries have securitized protests in order to criminalize
dissent.[^667] Even if studies reveal that digital monitoring may have a
dampening effect on police's use of force, videos show the persistence
of violations.[^668] Surveillance concerns pose different threats for
poor Black favela protestors in the Global South. The dynamics of social
movements in those contexts thus differ from the North, where resistance
does not frequently face "hard" techniques of repression, like
pre-emptive arrests, surveillance, riot police, arrests, prosecution,
and incarceration.

To avoid trouble, protesters in Brazil relay police warnings. People who
could not be on the streets due to the pandemic were asked to share
activists' posts and give visibility to their actions. The airing of
information in recent protests elucidates the consequences of
datafication in collective action. The paradigm shift able to transform
"social movement society" here urges scholars to reflect on how it
intersects with known protest dynamics. My intention in this chapter is
to share reflections on how movements will be organized during the
pandemic. My reflections reveal nuances of protesting in pandemic times
in Brazil and other areas in the Global Souths. The impact of COVID-19
on the Global Souths relates to both surveillance and grassroots efforts
to counter narratives of long-term negotiations between protestors and
police forces, especially young, Black favela residents who are
surveilled and disrespected daily. In response, they develop
counter-surveillance strategies to tackle police abuse, such as large
scale "cop watching."[^669]

Police violence may strike readers as unprecedented in Global North
outside racial protests, but it is ubiquitous in Brazil. A review of
protest in pandemic times from a US vantage point, for example, does not
consider what was mentioned above.[^670] However, there is an extensive
literature on "cop watching" and surveillance in the last few
years.[^671] In Brazil, massive protests in June, 2013 were among the
origins of more intensive and rationalized "cop watching."

Some challenges for future protests in the Global South are how they
rely on the logic of numbers, and how the relevance of these movements
is affected by the prohibition of big gatherings, since they cannot
proceed with their usual repertoires of protest. Also, as mass media
have played an important part in disseminating information about social
movements, and technologies have reinforced monopolies in this pandemic
period, we must acknowledge alternative uses of counter-stream
technologies, such as police accountability "cop watching. Aside from
protesting to end violent policing, there are civil initiatives fighting
the government's use of harmful face surveillance technology.[^672]
Later this month two major vendors---Amazon and IBM---announced that in
light of recent protests against police brutality and racial injustice,
they would pause or end their sale of surveillance technology to police.
The movement to ban facial recognition is increasing, as recent protests
have shown activists' strength in fighting tech companies that enable
and profit off of a system of racist surveillance and policing.

In Brazil, Optical Character Recognition has been widely supported by
the federal government and recently implemented in some states, showing
flaws that increased the mass incarceration of young, Black favela
habitants. These are the same residents who know first-hand how dire
data policies are for them, as 91% of those incarcerated by facial
monitoring in Brazil are Black. It is no wonder that surveillance seems
to work differently in the global North and South. Counter-surveillance
must take into account how social control of movements works---not just
repressing activists, but changing the terrain upon which they operate,
and transforming the most immediate struggles they must confront in
order to succeed.

This chapter has briefly analysed the rise of the securitization of
protests in Latin-America to criminalize dissent. I have stated how the
dynamics of southern movements---with similar causes, such as
racism---still differ from the Global North. In this context, I have
highlighted the Brazilian Military Police because its "hard" techniques
of repression have gained attention in the shift of its deployment of
force. In the last few months, strategies of counter-surveillance
collectives such as "cop watching" have gained relevance in social
movements that fight human rights abuse. Some challenges for the future
include how activists will cope with the consequences of datafication
and violence in collective action.

*Children from precarious families have been more affected by the
coronavirus pandemic because of their poor economic conditions. The
organization of citizens through social movements has effectively drawn
attention to the lack of public policies that serve the poorest
families.*

Estos tiempos de pandemia, por su excepcionalidad como acontecimiento,
así como de las medidas que los diferentes gobiernos han debido tomar en
nombre de salud pública, son tiempos difíciles para todos. Sin embargo,
los menores que eran beneficiarios de las becas de comedor de la
Comunidad de Madrid, capital de España, alrededor de 11.500 niños, han
visto su condición todavía más precarizada. Estos niños percibían estas
becas de comedor por la situación de vulnerabilidad en la que se
encontraban sus familias, beneficiarias de la renta mínima de inserción,
que consiste en una cuantía de entre 512,67 EUR al mes para núcleos
familiares de dos personas y de 587,78 EUR para tres personas, con la
posibilidad de llegar a un máximo de 950 EUR para todo el núcleo
familiar.[^673] Estos niños recibían a través de las becas de comedor,
en sus centros de estudios, una comida sana al día. La Comunidad de
Madrid rescindió los contratos que tenía con las empresas de catering en
los centros escolares el 11 de marzo, y seis días después, el 17 de
marzo, la presidenta de la comunidad, Isabel Díaz Ayuso, anunció que
había firmado un nuevo convenio con las empresas de comida Telepizza y
Rodilla. El menú aprobado para los más de 11.000 niños en situación de
exclusión consiste en pizzas, hamburguesas, ensaladas y nuggets de
pollo, por parte de Telepizza, y sándwiches, ensaladas y bocadillos
acompañados de dos piezas de fruta a la semana, ofrecidos por Rodilla.

Además, los niños de familias en situación de vulnerabilidad económica
se enfrentan a otro problema: la interrupción de su educación. Al
suspenderse las clases presenciales en los colegios e institutos por el
COVID-19, los niños y las niñas más vulnerables han sufrido serios
problemas para continuar las clases que, desde entonces, son todas
online. La falta de ordenadores o tablets, así como la conexión a
internet ha mostrado cómo afecta la brecha tecnológica a los más
vulnerables (un 3% de las familias con menores en España, según el
Instituto Nacional de Estadística). De momento, la oenegé Save the
Children ha tenido que atender a más de 1.500 familias para
proporcionarles las herramientas necesarias para continuar con el
curso.[^674]

El confinamiento ha mostrado sin ambages la profundidad de los problemas
a los que se enfrentan las familias más vulnerables en España. No es
solo la privación material severa que se traduce en la imposibilidad de
continuar con sus clases, sino también los problemas mentales derivados
de la falta de espacio.[^675] Según un informe de la oenegé Cáritas, 769
menores viven en una habitación en un piso compartido con su familia en
la ciudad de Barcelona dada la imposibilidad de pagar un espacio más
grande.[^676] No es admisible que algo tan básico como la vivienda se
deje en manos de especuladores que convierten al fondo de inversión
Blackstone en el mayor casero de España, porque nunca antepondrán el
derecho a la vivienda a sus beneficios económicos.

Según la Red Europea de Lucha contra la Pobreza y la Exclusión social,
un 21,6% de la población en España se encuentra dentro de la tasa de
riesgo de pobreza.[^677] La crisis del coronavirus ha hecho visible la
fragilidad de los niños de estas familias con escasos recursos
económicos. Sin embargo, las familias, las asociaciones, las oenegés y
las fundaciones llevan muchos años alertando de la precariedad en la que
se encuentran más de 10.000.000 de personas en España, entre ellas el
30% de los niños del país. La pregunta que deberíamos hacernos es por
qué se permite que los niños de familias pobres se alimenten con comida
basura durante casi dos meses o por qué no ha sido una prioridad del
gobierno garantizar la educación de los niños sin recursos.

### Tejiendo Redes {#tejiendo-redes .BOOK_Heading-3}

Los movimientos vecinales, las asociaciones de padres y madres de los
colegios, los diferentes movimientos sociales por la vivienda, así como
varias oenegés, han creado redes de apoyo para las familias más
vulnerables en estos momentos. Además del apoyo con material tecnológico
por parte de Save the Children, algunas Asociaciones de Madres y Padres
de Alumnos han querido colaborar donando ordenadores para los niños más
vulnerables. También hemos visto cómo algunos vecinos han hecho turnos
en los supermercados para solicitar la colaboración ciudadana para donar
comida a los bancos de alimentos o cómo se han organizado redes para ir
a hacer la compra a las personas que no podían salir de sus casas, entre
los que debemos destacar la organización del Sindicato de Vendedores
Ambulantes de Barcelona, que ha creado un banco de alimentos para las
personas que se dedicaban a la venta ambulante y han visto su actividad
interrumpida por las medidas adoptadas durante la cuarentena. Los
vecinos voluntarios de Malasaña, Conde Duque y Chueca[^678] han creado
un banco de alimentos que, de momento, entrega comida a 55 familias a la
semana.[^679] Todos estos movimientos comparten una tónica común: el
recurso de las soluciones tecnológicas para conseguir fines
estrictamente sociales. Algunos movimientos que ya existían antes de la
pandemia, como el Sindicato de Vendedores Ambulantes de Barcelona o el
colectivo Malasaña Acompaña han adaptado sus actividades a las
necesidades derivadas de la crisis sanitaria y las redes sociales han
desempeñado un papel fundamental durante la crisis a la hora de difundir
estas actividades y poder llegar a un mayor número de beneficiarios.
Otras iniciativas, surgidas durante la pandemia, se han definido desde
el inicio por su marcado carácter digital. Por ejemplo, el colectivo
Efecto Llamada es un movimiento rigurosamente digital que está teniendo
un impacto, de momento, en más 200 personas. Esta iniciativa ha
aprovechado la cuarentena para conectar a través de Twitter a personas
migrantes que quieran aprender castellano con voluntarios para
conversar. De esta forma, a través de videollamadas, se da toda la
libertad a las parejas participantes para ajustar sus horarios y
participar de la forma que mejor les convenga. El uso de diferentes
hashtags (\#despensasolidaria, \#RegularizacionYa o \#HuelgaAlquileres)
ha permitido lanzar campañas para solicitar ayuda, como el caso de los
bancos de alimentos, pero también para demandar soluciones
institucionales, como es el caso de \#RegularizacionYa, que exige la
regularización de las personas migrantes que, por su condición
administrativa, se ven expulsados del sistema de derecho.

Es necesario poner de relieve que esta crisis sanitaria ha demostrado,
una vez más, la importancia del cuidado de la vida desde lo comunitario.
Las formas de lo común se han revelado en las diferentes iniciativas de
cooperación que se han ido tejiendo en el cuidado de los otros durante
la pandemia, curiosamente enmarcados en una época de distanciamiento
social. La posibilidad de un mundo común se manifiesta en la existencia
de estas redes que niegan la privatización de la existencia. Porque la
pobreza de nuestras ciudades no nos puede ser indiferente, sigamos
construyendo tejido social.

## COVID-19 in Argentina: When the Micro-Practices of Activism fit in a WhatsApp Message (Raquel Tarullo) {#covid-19-in-argentina-when-the-micro-practices-of-activism-fit-in-a-whatsapp-message-raquel-tarullo .BOOK_Heading-2}

Circles of friends, members of sports clubs, parent associations, and
work colleagues in Argentina have started to provide food and clothing
during the pandemic for thousands of families who live in poverty. These
groups---neither social movements nor civic associations---use their
WhatsApp contacts and network to promote their food drives to prepare
meals that they deliver once a week. Parallel to this trend, teachers of
schools with vulnerable student bodies find in WhatsApp a channel for
communicating with families and accompanying students in what the
government has called a "Pedagogical Continuity Plan"---as most students
do not have access to the internet or technological devices. Teachers
also use this platform for sharing useful information, such as state
assistance payment calendars and the WhatsApp direct line for reporting
gender or familiar violence, with students' families.

### A Universal Platform {#a-universal-platform .BOOK_Heading-3}

WhatsApp has become Argentina's best ally for activism since the
national government established a severe lockdown on March 20. The
platform is used by groups of people to organize themselves to prepare
meals for poor families that COVID-19 has impacted. WhatsApp is the only
channel that teachers of schools with vulnerable student bodies have,
not only for interacting with their students' families, but also for
being a communication bridge between the government and their students'
families. The use of this platform in Argentina is almost universal, and
more than 90% of the population use it to stay connected, share
statuses, sell goods, and spread news. Currently, it is also used for
performing micro repertoires of activism.

More than half of kids and teenagers live below the poverty line in
Argentina. According to the last UNICEF report of COVID-19 effects in
the country, that percentage will reach 58% by the end of this year. The
national government has taken socio-economic measures to keep the
situation under control, such as the Ingreso Familiar de Emergencia
(Emergency Household Income), a state assistance for poor families, and
zero interest rate loans for the self-employed with minimum or low
income. Despite these efforts, most Argentines have been suffering
through crises in recent years that have widened gaps greatly.

Half the country's workforce are employed in an informal economy,
working under the table and surviving on changas---one-day jobs that
allow for minimal daily sustenance. Cartoneros, who live from the sale
of recycled garbage, are part of this vulnerable group. This precarious
segment has been the most affected by the direct and indirect effects of
the pandemic. Social movements and civil associations have warned that
these people from the most vulnerable urban areas will be the most
affected by COVID-19. La Garganta Poderosa, an NGO that has
representation in many countries of Latin America, last week launched a
social media campaign \#contagiásolidaridad ("\#infectsolidarity") to
promote collective awareness of the situation.

### A Diffusional Space for the Urgency {#a-diffusional-space-for-the-urgency .BOOK_Heading-3}

*Olla de Mujeres* ("Saucepan of women") is a group formed by five girls,
only two of whom knew each other before. They decided to come together
after exchanging messages through WhatsApp, and they used this channel
to organize themselves. Since April, they have been using this channel
to post a flyer in their statuses with information about the goods they
need for preparing meals, along with their WhatsApp numbers. As they are
very active and social, they use many WhatsApp groups to share this
information. The members of these groups replicate their messages,
building an informal network of solidarity. *Olla de Mujeres* receive
messages from unknown people, offering supplies and help. As they have a
special permit issued by the authorities and are required to drive
around during lockdown, they collect donations all around the city. An
NGO lends them its kitchen facilities for cooking. Every Saturday, they
distribute the meals to a hundred families.

Fernando is 22 years old and has many friends through WhatsApp. He uses
these contacts for food drives. He creates WhatsApp broadcast lists and
his parents do the same, helping him to promote his campaign of food
donations. Fernando and his lifelong friends cook every Saturday in the
kitchen of the club where he plays volleyball. Last Saturday, they
distributed more than 200 meals to people who went to a merendero---a
food bank for low-income residents.

###  {#section-30 .BOOK_Heading-3}

### Schools and WhatsApp {#schools-and-whatsapp .BOOK_Heading-3}

School teachers have a fundamental place in this network for diffusions
and emergencies. Schools are one of the institutions that have deeply
transformed themselves to adapt to the current situation. The majority
of schools that are settled in popular and deprived areas of the country
offer breakfast, lunch, and afternoon snacks to their students. However,
since on-site classes were suspended, teachers are now in charge of
delivering a bag of food every other week---a measure that the national
government has introduced to replace school meals and increase social
assistance to these families. Along with the food provisions, teachers
distribute school booklets for students to continue with their
education, in order to guarantee the Pedagogical Continuity Plan. Formal
class instruction also benefits from communication on WhatsApp. "Far
from other schools that can work via Google Classroom, Zoom or other
platforms, our unique way of communication with families and students is
via WhatsApp. In our community, families do not have neither internet
access nor computers. We give them these booklets, and then we try to
continue communication using WhatsApp," says Jéssica, head of a school
in the province of Buenos Aires.

However, the content of these booklets has received much criticism. The
Mapuche's Confederation---the NGO that congregates native people settled
in the south of the country---reported that they were described using
discriminatory language as a vanished community. The National Ministry
of Education then publicly apologized to the community.

Even though browsing the governmental site educ.ar---where students
and/or their parents can download these booklets---is free of charge and
contents can be downloaded without consuming mobile data, access is
almost impossible for families with many kids and only one mobile phone
per household. "Besides, most of these parents haven't finished their
primary studies. Even if they had mobiles or computers, they wouldn't
have the digital skills for accessing to these sites and downloading the
pedagogical material," says Valeria, a social worker who uses WhatsApp
to help women of impoverished communities by sending them information
about State health assistance for them and their kids.

Nevertheless, communication over WhatsApp largely exceeds pedagogical
goals. "At the beginning, it was for school purposes, but currently we
use it to share useful information that runs in other social media, such
as Facebook and Instagram, which families of our school may not have
access to," explains Jéssica. In this group formed by teachers and
families, schools share information about where they can get free food
during the weekends, state assistance payment calendars, and dates food
bags will be delivered. For instance, news of a WhatsApp direct line for
reporting gender and domestic violence that was launched recently by the
government were shared by teachers using WhatsApp groups. The pandemic
in Argentina has revealed repertoires, dynamics and resistances of a
"backstage activism" that uses WhatsApp for creating networks,
organizing solidarities, helping kids with their education, spreading
information, and asking for help. All of these micro practices are part
of an activism that has become more vital during COVID-19.

## Under Other Skies: Astronomy as a Tool to Face COVID-19-Induced Isolation in the Indigenous Village of Aldeia Verde, Brazil (Arianna Cortesi, Claudia Magnani, Roberto Romero, Paula C.P. Silva, Sueli Maxakali, Isael Maxakali, Ana Maria R. Gomes) {#under-other-skies-astronomy-as-a-tool-to-face-covid-19-induced-isolation-in-the-indigenous-village-of-aldeia-verde-brazil-arianna-cortesi-claudia-magnani-roberto-romero-paula-c.p.-silva-sueli-maxakali-isael-maxakali-ana-maria-r.-gomes .BOOK_Heading-2}

OtherSkies, an OAD/IAU-funded project, tackles these questions by
collecting native narratives, chants, and myths about the sky that have
never been written down and recorded before, in collaboration with
researchers of the Indigenous Village Aldeia Verde in Brazil.[^680] Soon
after the project started, all Universities and the majority of services
in Brazil shut down due to the rapid diffusion of the pandemic to all
the federal states. To protect the indigenous people, the federal
government declared the lockdown of the communities^.^[^681] Even so,
the first cases of COVID-19 appeared in many indigenous areas of the
country, some of which, due to the absence of internet and phone
connection, faced severe isolation. Aldeia Nova is one of the indigenous
villages of the Maxakali people that suffered this destiny. To overcome
the difficulties of communications, the International Astronomical Union
(IAU)-funded project "Other Skies" was modified to grant internet
connection to the village, support the independent recording and
production of material on indigenous astronomy, and start a virtual
gallery for sharing astronomical Maxakali knowledge and their
perspective of the world.

### Under Other Skies: Dialogues of Different Cosmological Paradigms {#under-other-skies-dialogues-of-different-cosmological-paradigms .BOOK_Heading-3}

The project "Under other skies" focuses on ethno-astronomy, particularly
the astronomical knowledge of the Maxakali people, an indigenous
population of Brazil. The *Tikmũ'ũn* people, better known as Maxakali,
live in one of the smallest indigenous lands in the State of Minas
Gerais, Southeast Brazil, which has been completely devastated by the
late colonization of the area. Despite the loss of their territory and
the increasing contact with the National Society, the richness of the
symbolic and ritual dimensions of their world has attracted great
ethnographic interest in the last century. A deep look at the Maxakali
experience in everyday life, such as in ritual sphere, immediately shows
us the complexity of the Maxakali sociality and cosmology. All their
knowledge and practices are made by performing shamanic rituals through
which they interact with non-human agencies (the *yãmiyxop spirits*)
that inhabit their territory, sharing feasts, chants, food, and other
many practices with them. From the Maxakali perspective, we can see that
there are no clear boundaries between knowledge and practice, between
the ancient past and the present, or between everyday life and ritual
life. Everything in their experience, even astronomical knowledge, is
inserted in a space-time continuum, which is activated by the constant
power of memory and through the relationship with the multiple non-human
subjectivities that inhabit it.

The idea of a dialog between scientific and indigenous knowledge about
the sky was born from an encounter between one of the astronomers and
two indigenous researchers and sciamans (leaders) of the community. The
project will be conducted in Aldeia Nova, a Maxakali Village in Minas
Gerais, and involves indigenous researchers, shamans, and elders of the
village collaborating with anthropologists and educators of the Federal
University of Minas Gerais, and astronomers and educators of the
University of São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. The main objective is to
collect and translate native narratives, chants and myths about the sky
narrated by some of the elders that have never been written down and
recorded before.[^682]

### IAU Office of Astronomy for Development  {#iau-office-of-astronomy-for-development .BOOK_Heading-3}

The project was funded by the Office of Astronomy for Development[^683],
a joint project of the International Astronomical Union (IAU)[^684] and
the South African National Research Foundation (NRF) with the support of
the Department of Science and Innovation (DSI). Its mission is to use
astronomy to make the world a better place, reminding us that we
earthlings[^685] live in a pale blue dot orbiting one of the millions of
billions of stars of this amazing and expanding universe.[^686] Every
year, the OAD funds several astronomy-related projects that promote
sustainable development through astronomy.

### The Potential Risk we Could not Imagine {#the-potential-risk-we-could-not-imagine .BOOK_Heading-3}

One of the questions of the OAD selection form is "Describe potential
risks and how you will address these?" The words we wrote to answer this
question describe several obstacles, without one mention of a world
pandemic. The Other Sky project was based on the idea of a dialogue,
developed in workshops, meetings, encounters at the margins, that
eventually never took place; neither seemed plausible in the nearest
future. Yet, we couldn't give up! So we decided to restructure the
entire project. To face this situation we altered the project schedule
and budget, including the acquisition of an internet radio connection
for Aldeia Nova, purchases of of computers and material to record and
produce films and audio in the Aldeia. We also planned to create a
virtual gallery, following the example of the exhibition *Mundos
Indigenas* at Espaço do Conhecimento of the Federal University of Minas
Gerais, in Belo Horizonte. These encounters left space for independence,
and the audience became global. 

### The Virtual Gallery and the Space of Knowledge {#the-virtual-gallery-and-the-space-of-knowledge .BOOK_Heading-3}

The "Espaço do Conhecimento" (Space of knowledge) of UFMG launched the
exhibition *Mundos Indígenas* in December 2019, where the public was
presented with ways of living, knowing, and taking care from Maxakali,
Pataxoop, Xakriabá, Yanomami and Ye'kwana peoples. It showed that "the
history of Brazilian indigenous people is not only one." With the
closure of museums in late March due to the COVID-19 pandemic, visits to
the exhibition were suspended. The exhibition schedule was extended
until July 2021, which expanded the possibility of visitation, after the
reopening of the museums will be authorized. Meanwhile, Espaço do
Conhecimento UFMG prepared a series of new videos to provide the public
with the experience of a virtual visit to the exhibition through YouTube
videos, launched on September 21. The six videos of the Virtual Visit to
the Mundos Indígenas Exhibition are available to the public on the
Espaço do Conhecimento UFMG channel on YouTube, alongside messages from
indigenous curators and a video on the teheys of Dona Liça
Pataxoop.[^687]

### A Virtual Re-birth {#a-virtual-re-birth .BOOK_Heading-3}

The project Other Skies, supported and inspired by the virtual
exhibition *Mundos Indígenas*, will also create a virtual gallery to
present Maxakali astronomy. The gallery will also include images taken
from the Southern Photometric Local universe Survey collaboration
(S-PLUS),[^688] a Spanish-Brazilian collaboration, to map the southern
sky in twelve colours. The virtual exhibition will exemplify the
heterogeneity of astronomical knowledge. Through an intercultural
approach, it will promote an understanding of the different astronomical
paradigms, and push back against a superficial approach to science and
social biodiversity. An example is the story *Star Women*[^689]*,*
already available in the exhibition Mundos Indigenous. Although COVID-19
marginalized even more Indigenous communities, it created the grounding
for the diffusion of their knowledge worldwide. One day we will grab our
telescopes and travel up north to the silent dark skies of the Aldeia
Nova, to look with different eyes at the same infinite spaces.

## Fighting for Feminist COVID-19 Figures: A Call for Feminist Data Visualizations During the Pandemic (Erinne Paisley) {#fighting-for-feminist-covid-19-figures-a-call-for-feminist-data-visualizations-during-the-pandemic-erinne-paisley .BOOK_Heading-2}

During the COVID-19 global pandemic, we have all had to make
signification adjustments to our daily lives. One of these adjustments
is reading more news, which contains an endless stream of data. It has
been up to government bodies, health organizations, and journalists to
sort through this data and create visuals for us to understand it.

These visualizations are crucial to help us sort through the constant
noise of data that the pandemic has created. In this way, COVID-19 has
created a trend of data visualization. However, even well-meaning
COVID-19 images such as ["]{dir="rtl"}flatten the curve" are not
completely objective.[^690] Data visualizations make visible certain
perspectives and experiences, empowering and disempowering certain
demographics. Historically, the experiences of womxn (especially womxn
of colour) have not been included.[^691]

D[']{dir="rtl"}Ignazio and Klein coined the term ["]{dir="rtl"}feminist
data visualizations" to describe data visualizations that empower women
by revealing their perspectives and experiences.[^692] Feminist data
visualization is still not the mainstream way of sorting and presenting
data. When it comes to data handling surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic,
in March 2020 Wenham et al. explained that were, ["]{dir="rtl"}not aware
of any gender analysis of the outbreak by global health institutions or
governments in affected countries or in preparedness phases."[^693]

As of early April 2020, non-profits such as Plan International, as well
as academic think tanks like the Centre for Feminist Foreign Policy,
have begun to support womxn[']{dir="rtl"}s rights during the COVID-19
pandemic.[^694] Journalists like Helen Lewis of The Atlantic, with her
popular article" []{dir="rtl"}The Coronavirus Is a Disaster for
Feminism", have also highlighted the experiences of womxn. However, the
lack of feminist data visualizations is also evident.[^695]

To explore the importance of feminist data visualizations amidst the
COVID-19 pandemic, I look to two examples of women[']{dir="rtl"}s
perspectives and experiences during this time, exploring specifically
the pandemic[']{dir="rtl"}s impact on increased rates of domestic
violence and decreased rates of women[']{dir="rtl"}s education globally.
I will also zoom in on examples of past feminist data visualizations of
these two topics that could be used as jumping-off points for health
institutions and governments to conduct similar work during COVID-19.

### Increased Rates of Domestic Violence {#increased-rates-of-domestic-violence .BOOK_Heading-3}

Domestic violence, also referred to as "intimate partner violence
(IPV)", is a ["]{dir="rtl"}pattern of behaviors used by one partner to
maintain power and control over another partner in an intimate
relationship."[^696] Domestic violence is the most prevalent type of
violence against womxn and has been categorized by scholars as a "global
pandemic" of its own.[^697] According to the World Health Organization
(WHO), 1 in 3 women worldwide has experienced physical or sexual
intimate partner violence.[^698]

This global public health problem has historically been under-addressed.
This is because the ["]{dir="rtl"}home" was regarded as
["]{dir="rtl"}private" until the second wave of the feminist movement in
the 1960s and [19]{dir="rtl"}70s,[^699] During this feminist wave,
slogans like ["]{dir="rtl"}the personal is political," created by Carol
Hanisch, encouraged accountability for womxn[']{dir="rtl"}s rights both
in the public and private realm.[^700] This accountability included
addressing issues such as the allocation of duties within the household,
domestic violence, as well as other social and legal rights within
womxn[']{dir="rtl"}s ["]{dir="rtl"}private" lives. During widespread
public emergencies in the past, there has been a clear association
between these events and rising rates of domestic abuse. For instance,
after the New Zealand ["]{dir="rtl"}Canterbury" earthquake in 2010,
there was recorded 53% rise in domestic violence. Following Hurricane
Katrina in the United States, domestic violence rates in the affected
areas [nearly
doubled](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/288432753_The_hidden_disaster_Domestic_violence_in_the_aftermath_of_natural_disaster).[^701]

### Existing Feminist Data Visualization[']{dir="rtl"}s of Domestic Violence {#existing-feminist-data-visualizations-of-domestic-violence .BOOK_Heading-3}

In 2009, researchers at Harvard University created a computer model that
automatically detected at-risk patients for domestic abuse.[^702] This
program sorted through huge amounts of medical data from US hospital
emergency visits and created data visualizations referred to as
["]{dir="rtl"}risk gel" for physicians to view. The bars represented the
patient[']{dir="rtl"}s medical history, specifically visits to a medical
practitioner, colour coded based on the historical association of these
injuries to domestic abuse. This visualization of data allowed for
further prevention and attention to cases of domestic abuse by
physicians. It was a form of feminist data visualization because it
challenged the binary of one single visit to a doctor being marked as
evidence of domestic abuse or not. Instead, it tracked multiple visits
on a scale of injury to create a narrative evidence of abuse. This
example of feminist data visualization shows how feminist data
visualizations can reveal hidden narratives within existing data, and
support womxn[']{dir="rtl"}s rights.

###  At-Home Education Effect on Womxn {#at-home-education-effect-on-womxn .BOOK_Heading-3}

Most data visualizations of the COVID-19 pandemic assume that its
effects will end with the eradication of the virus. Although this will
be a significant turning point in the pandemic[']{dir="rtl"}s
trajectory, from a feminist perspective this is in no way to know when
the effects of the virus will end. As of April 2020, over 91% of the
world[']{dir="rtl"}s student population has had to stay home from school
(UNESCO, 2020). Following historical trends, the role of educating
children in the home will fall mostly on womxn.[^703] Traditionally,
womxn are still those who worldwide take the principle responsibility
for children. This increased responsibility in the home may lead to
detrimental effects for womxn[']{dir="rtl"}s own careers once
pandemic-related quarantine has ended, as male counterparts will have
advanced further during the quarantine period due to fewer home-school
responsibilities.

Girls around the world face additional barriers to their educational,
and eventually professional, progressions. Feminist data studies on the
2014 Ebola epidemic found that womxn still often have less
decision-making power than men, which results in fewer female students
returning to school once the institutions are re-opened.[^704] Global
studies have also shown that the longer a child is out of school, the
more likely they are to not return. One of the main reasons that girls
do not return to school is the increased rate of unwanted and
transactional sex. A study by the United Nations Development Programme
on the Ebola epidemic showed that teenage pregnancies in some

### Feminist Data Visualization: Female Education Rates {#feminist-data-visualization-female-education-rates .BOOK_Heading-3}

In 2018, American researchers experimented with data visualization as
part of the annual February celebration of Black History.[^706] This
challenge to ["]{dir="rtl"}\#VisualizeDiversity" resulted in a feminist
data visualization submitted to the project by a researcher named
Sharon.[^707] The visualization took the data from the United
States[']{dir="rtl"} Department of Education fourth grade basic reading
skills and re-organized it. The presentation of the data showed a hidden
narrative: most minorities in America struggle to read at grade level
and, more broadly, there are systemic barriers that prevent them from
excelling. Sharon[']{dir="rtl"}s data visualization showed the potential
of feminist data visualizations to reveal a narrative that the initial
sorting of data may not have focused on. By re-sorting the data to focus
on minority status, the data went beyond categories of
["]{dir="rtl"}literate" and ["]{dir="rtl"}illiterate" and began to show
the multiplicity of reasons for literacy gaps. In these ways, the data
visualization acknowledged the historical exclusion of these
marginalized groups in traditional hierarchical power structures.

### Conclusions {#conclusions .BOOK_Heading-3}

The COVID-19 global pandemic has led to a larger consumption of data
visualizations. It is clear that data visualizations are needed not just
for an understanding of the crisis at hand, but to instruct the public
on what actions are the most crucial to take. Most viral data
visualizations of the pandemic to date have focused on the spread of the
virus---including images such as ["]{dir="rtl"}Flatten the Curve" and
its accompanying \#stayhome social media campaign. We must continue to
question the objectivity of these viral data visualizations asking
questions such as: When the curve ends, is this really the end of the
pandemic[']{dir="rtl"}s impact? Is \#stayhome really helping everyone
stay safe? So far, viral COVID-19 pandemic data visualizations have
focused on a narrow perspective and largely exclude the experience and
risks for womxn around the world. However, this also creates an
opportunity for feminist data visualizations as they rise in popularity.
The world is watching for data visualizations, asking how to help, and
supporting one another. It[']{dir="rtl"}s time to include womxn.

    in the Netherlands. The report remarked on how 'the EU countries
