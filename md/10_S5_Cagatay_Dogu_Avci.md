# Visual Violence in Turkish Cinema: Perspectives from Southeastern Anatolia (1960-1990)

## Introduction

Cinema, either directly or indirectly, presents the truth through its
narrative, and does this through representations of realities in any
society. In certain respects, cinema is a series of selected truths from
reality,[^10_S5_Cagatay_Dogu_Avci_1] while on the other hand, violence of all kinds is immanent
to it.[^10_S5_Cagatay_Dogu_Avci_2] As such, cinema allows us to evaluate the extent of practices
of violence that people are subjected to in the society they live in and
the spaces where it takes place. One might than ask: Is the
representation of violence on screen simply a reflection of reality or
fiction? If so, what kind of architectural representation does this
“fictitious reality” in cinema find?

When exploring the cinematic dimension of violence, it is important to
look at the spaces and gender linked to violence.[^10_S5_Cagatay_Dogu_Avci_3] Space is not
merely a physical entity but a social production[^10_S5_Cagatay_Dogu_Avci_4] hence acquires an
emotional meaning through perceptions. Space than becomes a constitutive
element for understanding the social and cultural construction of
violence. Since space is inseparable from everyday practices and social
relations, violence is a hierarchical representation to interpret and
control people through space. Drawing on this intertwined relationship
between space and violence in the context of the films, this study looks
at rural life in Southern Anatolia in the second half of twentieth
century Turkey. The study aims to examine the representations of women
in spaces where they encounter violence and how in turn, the practices
of violence in these spaces are portrayed in cinema.

Articulated in the form of a visual essay, the study will illustrate how
women, subjected to violence through exposure to abuse and silencing in
the public realm, internalize the domestic space. However, since the
violence continues in the domestic space in the selected films, women
remain trapped in the cycle of domestic violence and domestic practices
impose their own limitations. When analysing in the context of women’s
spaces, the selected films thus provide a context for exploring the role
of domestic and public violence, along with psychological abuse.

For this study, eleven films[^10_S5_Cagatay_Dogu_Avci_5] set in Southeastern Anatolia have been
chosen from a wider collection of films analysed for larger research.
The choice of Southeastern Anatolia is not accidental, as the transition
from feudalism to capitalism, terrorism, coup, smuggling as well as
social elements such as culture and traditions between 1960 and 1990[^10_S5_Cagatay_Dogu_Avci_6]
were only a few among the long list of critical socio-political and
socio-cultural issues that the region witnessed in the twentieth century
and that are represented in cinema. These upheavals in society were
directly reflected on women and their abuse, so that in reality and as
reflected in the cinema, women have become subjects of violence, trapped
both inside and outside, indoors and outdoors. Such confinement or
restriction was not only evident as a physical experience, lived in and
acquired through space, but also carried symbolic meanings with bodily
consequences. As reflected in cinema, the abuse silenced women as others
tried to control their perceptions and their voice. Examining this
aspect of violence against women in film narratives belonging to a
particular culture, customs and traditions is important in terms of
observing women’s place in any given setting; in this case, the domestic
realm – as the house – and the public realm – as communal spaces – of
rural Anatolia. This study attempts to unfold these issues via the
support of visuals prepared from striking scenes from films depicting
violence, abuse and silencing of women in architectural space. The
visuals accompanying the essay were treated as “text,” often stronger
than any written word.

## At Home: Violence in Architectural Space

The interaction between women and domestic space is directly related to
the domination of the woman’s body; women is a mere signifier in
space.[^10_S5_Cagatay_Dogu_Avci_7] The home as the domestic space thus becomes a cultural
construct and the meaning of home reflects the identity of a family as
part of the larger social and communal order. In this regard, domestic
space in films incorporate various meanings. Although the architecture
in domestic cinematic scenes varies, the woman’s relationship with
domestic space remains similar across different cultures. It is the
place where her identity is assimilated and her role is reduced to
performing domestic service, ensuring the continuity of the home and the
family. When this role is analysed within the patriarchal system, it is
no surprise that this is a result of ownership; more specifically,
firstly the ownership of the house, and secondly the ownership of what
is inside the house considered as objects that belonged to men,
including women.[^10_S5_Cagatay_Dogu_Avci_8] This masculine understanding of authority, which
reinforced the patriarchal system, became more complex as violence was
introduced to this dynamic which shaped the long and complicated social
history of “women’s role in space”, or more simply interwoven
relationships between women and space.[^10_S5_Cagatay_Dogu_Avci_9] Therefore, the dominance over
the domestic space is identical with the dominance over the body,
resulting in the “domestic violence”. For a better understanding of the
representation of domestic violence in films depicting the rural areas
of Southeastern Anatolia, it is important to recognize the perception of
Anatolian women and roles which were defined for them. One of these
roles is that of a female offspring, considered from birth as an asset
which will eventually bring money to the father in control of the
family’s capital through marriage with the *başlık parası*, translated
as the bride-price.[^10_S5_Cagatay_Dogu_Avci_10] Thus, female member of the family is a
temporary member in the family from the moment of her birth. After
marriage, the woman assumes a similar role as an asset. This time woman
becomes a “permanent” member of her husband’s family, a domestic worker
responsible for all the chores. Moreover, women assume the role of both
wife and domestic worker who has no option of returning to her father’s
house. As embedded in social codes, her new home is now her destiny, and
chains. This relationship that the woman establishes with the house
ensures that she is under the control of the property owner, be it
husband or father.

Looking at the narratives of the selected films, this is evident in all
of them. For instance, in the film Hazal (1979),[^10_S5_Cagatay_Dogu_Avci_11] Hazal’s (portrayed
by Türkan Şoray) husband dies on her wedding day. By tradition, Hazal is
married off to her husband’s younger brother, who is around 10 years old
(!). Since the new bride Hazal’s husband is a child, Hazal is abused by
her mother-in-law in many aspects. The mother-in-law (she represents a
woman who is adopting patriarchal perspective, norms and persist) treats
Hazal as her own property and Hazal is the subject all the misgivings
and thus subjected to domestic violence (Figure 1).

Figure 1. Hazal (1979)

As reflected in films, leaving a first home is either through marriage
or death for women. Another dimension of psychological violence in the
film Hazal (1979) can be observed in the character Beşo (portrayed by
Keriman Ulusoy). Beşo is the sister-in-law who considers marriage as her
only option of escape from her house of birth. However, she could not
get married because of the bride-price demanded by her father and her
faith was thus sealed. Therefore, one day she hangs a cloth to a
wish-tree (an offering in Anatolian and other cultures with shamanistic
roots), then commits suicide and dies. Considering that suicide is
another sin among many encoded deep in the roots of bigoted culture, a
proper funeral is not organized, and she is hastily buried (Figure 2).

Figure 2. Hazal (1979)

A similar scenario takes place in the film Kara Çarşaflı Gelin
(1975).[^10_S5_Cagatay_Dogu_Avci_12] The main character Gülüşan (portrayed by Semra Özdamar) is
“sold” to another family at a young age in consideration of blood
money.[^10_S5_Cagatay_Dogu_Avci_13] From the beginning, she is seen as an income with her
bride-price (as a return of blood money), thus an object, subjected to
all kinds of violence in the house she was sold to. In these scenes, she
is confronted with gender-based violence (Figure 3). Suppressed, she
cannot even imagine an escape.

Figure 3. Kara Çarşaflı Gelin (1975)

In the following two films, Züğürt Ağa (1985)[^10_S5_Cagatay_Dogu_Avci_14] and Berdel
(1990),[^10_S5_Cagatay_Dogu_Avci_15] violence occurs when woman has no voice at home. While this
violence is physical in the film Züğürt Ağa, it is psychological in the
film Berdel. The film Züğürt Ağa is about the transition from feudalism
to capitalism. The film tells the story of a landlord who is deceived by
his villagers, loses all his money, and migrates to Istanbul. In the
film, the first wife[^10_S5_Cagatay_Dogu_Avci_16] does not consent to her husband’s second
marriage and becomes a victim of violence. This film portrays violence
against women in a humorous(!) way (Figure 4).

Figure 4. Züğürt Ağa (1985)

Sürü (1978)[^10_S5_Cagatay_Dogu_Avci_17] is a film about the transformation of a nomadic family
living in the rural areas and subsisting on animal husbandry in the
changing conditions of the period. The domestic violence on women is
narrated via stories of different women. With a wider perspective,
demonstrating this as a socio-cultural issue, the film focuses on
protagonist Berivan (portrayed by Melike Demirağ). Berivan, who cannot
stand the pressure exerted on her body, becomes silent, refuses to
speak, and becomes violent as a reflection of her abuse (Figure 5). This
is one of the rare portrayals where women search for a self-expression
against violence.

In the film Yol (1981),[^10_S5_Cagatay_Dogu_Avci_18] when the convicted Seyyit Ali (portrayed by
Tarık Akan) on leave visits his house, he learns that his wife Zine
(portrayed by Şerif Sezer) has been unfaithful to him. During his
imprisonment, his wife became a sex worker. After her family finds out,
they keep her in a storage room in the house. She is chained to the
house with iron bars, and customary demands keep her there until her
husband kills her. She harms family’s *namus*, meaning honour,[^10_S5_Cagatay_Dogu_Avci_19]
that’s why she is imprisoned until she is sentenced to death because of
*namusu temizlemek*, translated as cleansing of honour (Figure 6).[^10_S5_Cagatay_Dogu_Avci_20]

Figure 6. Yol (1981)

Another representation of women at home is death. Home is the place
where they die (!) or get killed, as demonstrated in the films Bedrana
(1974),[^10_S5_Cagatay_Dogu_Avci_21] Son Darbe (1985),[^10_S5_Cagatay_Dogu_Avci_22] İsyan (1979)[^10_S5_Cagatay_Dogu_Avci_23] and Ezo Gelin
(1973).[^10_S5_Cagatay_Dogu_Avci_24]

In the film Bedrana (1974), the character (portrayed by Perihan Savaş),
who also lends its name to the film, experiences social exclusion
following a sexual assault and is sentenced to capital punishment. Her
husband wants to execute her in line with the local custom. Upon
realizing this, Bedrana takes her own life (Figure 7).

Whereas in the film Son Darbe (1985), a woman (portrayed by Nilgün
Akçaoğlu) who had been subjected to sexual abuse while her husband was
in prison, tragically took her own life after their last encounter. The
soldiers discovered her demise (Figure 8).

In the film İsyan (1979), a woman (portrayed by Melike Zobu), who was
coerced into a marriage against her will (forced marriage being a kind
of violence), is murdered by her father in the name of *namus* (Figure
9).

Similarly, in the film Ezo Gelin (1973), Ezo’s (portrayed by Fatma
Girik) spouse was taken into the military shortly after their wedding.
Due to a misinterpretation of her husband’s death, she is compelled to
wed her deceased spouse’s sibling. Upon her husband’s return, she
commits suicide (Figure 10).

## In Village: Violence in Public

In the film narratives, the relationship of the female characters with
the outside world is realized to the extent permitted by the societal
order observed in the Anatolian rural. Women’s experience with the
external environment are therefore limited, and reflected in the films,
women either work as unpaid labourers in agriculture and/or use the
public space to support domestic duties once again (impossible to image
women without domesticity!) such as carrying water from the well or
washing clothes by the river. Apart from these duties, women are not
welcome in public space because they belong “home”.

In the film Berdel (1990), the woman is subjected to violence for going
out without her husband’s permission (Figure 11). In Ezo Gelin (1973), a
woman who goes out to carry water is warned by her brother to stay in
the house because she attracts attention in public which – in his
opinion – harms family’s *namus*, which harms families good name in the
village (Figure 12).

Figure 12. Ezo Gelin (1973)

Another dimension of violence in the film narrative is the harassment
faced by women in public spaces. The reason for this harassment is
because the public sphere is considered belonging to the men, and thus
in a religious/bigoted culture, it is not safe. For safety, women had to
travel in groups excluded from men or had to be accompanied by a male
relative. In the film İsyan (1979), the protagonist Ayno (portrayed by
Melike Zobu), alone in the public sphere of the village, is physically
harassed by a man on her way home (Figure 13).

![](media/image13.tif){width="5.905511811023622in"
height="5.049212598425197in"}

Figure 13. İsyan (1979)

In the film Kuma (1974),[^10_S5_Cagatay_Dogu_Avci_25] the protagonist Hanım (portrayed by Fatma
Girik) is harassed and assaulted when she goes to the wishing tree to
pray to fulfil another one of her domestic duties, to have a child
(Figure 14).

![](media/image14.jpeg){width="5.905511811023622in"
height="5.054103237095363in"}

Figure 14. Kuma (1974)

Harassment of women in public spaces is not limited to the issues
discussed so far. It further includes the act of forcibly removing a
woman from her home. It is a situation where at the age of marriage, the
men of the village believe they have the authority to compel a woman to
marry against her will and thus remove her from her house of birth. The
ultimate consequence of this situation is rape. In Bedrana (1974), as
punishment for an act, the protagonist women is unwillingly subjected,
the woman is murdered by her family for once again honour. The victim is
further victimized when the criminal walks free (Figure 15).

![](media/image15.jpeg){width="5.905511811023622in"
height="4.985593832020998in"}

Figure 15. Bedrana (1974)

Public form of violence conducted against women is not only an
individual act, but maybe conducted as groups, for instance angry mobs.
Representation of women characters in film narrative in public spaces is
the reflection of the social form of violence. In the film Kuma (1974),
the woman is accused of unfaithfulness and slandered by her husband’s
other wife. The accusations result in her being tied to a tree in the
village square and stoned by the angry villagers by her “so-called”
sins; a depiction of group violence against women is as manifested in
its cinematic form (Figure 16).

Figure 16. Kuma (1974)

In public sphere, which ultimately becomes the man’s space, the woman is
shown through her dead body. In the film Hazal (1979), the murder of the
protagonist in the village square as a punishment for her escape with
her lover, can be read as an acceptance of the social norm between
women, public sphere, and violence (Figure 17).

## Violence on Screen: A Tragic End?

The films reveal that brutal reflections of real life in
twentieth-century Southeastern Anatolia became a set of clichés for
romantic storytelling and melodramatic performance. These can be
summarized accordingly: Death was often portrayed as the only escape for
women characters in the face of violence or associated with
psychological coercion of women to commit suicide in domestic space or
public execution as a means of punishment. In the former, the act of
suicide becomes a response to violence against women in cinematic
representation. As a popular tool of expression, the act of suicide and
violence is in harmony with cinematography which exploits this suicidal
reality. In the latter, it was expressed by the public execution of
women as a communal punishment. The spatial dimension of violence
incorporated meanings parallel to the social construction of space in
cinema. Spaces, whether domestic and public, have been attributed
symbolic meanings. The space embodied not the identity of the abuser,
but the identities of the abused women. These implications suggest that
violence is an important component in the shaping of space not only in
real life but also in cinematic representations of space, and is
directly linked to the formation of gender based spaces which is a much
deeper topic to be covered here.[^10_S5_Cagatay_Dogu_Avci_26] While cinematic narratives portray
the perpetrator as a victim, those who perpetrate violence justify their
reasons for this as social norms, tradition and the social pressure that
comes with it. This discussion ends with a question: Is the visual
depiction of violence in films a reflection of societal realities, or is
it the tip of the mountain that is disseminated via mass media,
unconsciously exploited for cinematic storytelling without any
consideration of social implications? A deeper investigation might
reveal that this in fact is the case.
