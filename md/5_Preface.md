# Preface

# Design Horizons: Exploring Boundaries and Possibilities in Design

This book is the outcome of the Design Studies Symposium that took place
in June 2023 at the Izmir University of Economics, Faculty of Art and
Design. The research presented in the symposium and the articles in this
book as the symposium’s outcome delve into diverse fields of design with
varying scales and forms, tackling contemporary challenges that push the
boundaries of the design field and offer new possibilities for its
expansion. Although the content may initially appear unrelated, subtle
diversities emerge, offering multiple avenues that reflect the role of
design as a methodology and an instrument. Among the arguments, these
prevailed: What explorations emerge on the horizon in response to
trends? What functions do these recent developments serve, and how are
they challenging design?

The research presented in the symposium ranges from case/field
implementation ideas to quantitative/scientific data surveys to social,
theoretical, and historical studies from all subfields of design to
address the countless parallel and overlapping realities of design in
the post-pandemic era. The post-Covid period and unprecedented
earthquake have made us question the role of design in our everyday
lives, while the advent of dynamic technologies in design has made us
reconsider the design realities that surround us. For this book, quality
papers were collected from authors from different Graduate Programs
related to the field of design.

In terms of context, the aim within the framework of the book is to
bring together opinions from various design and/or disciplinary
backgrounds to develop a common and integrated design understanding
through philosophy, culture, history, theory, and contemporary
discourse, and also by considering the interactions between the arts and
science fields. To explore these inquiries, this book explores and
interrogates the intersections across diverse fields of design,
encompassing visual communication, fashion, architecture, interior
architecture, and industrial design. Treating these diverse approaches
offers a look into how design methodologies evolve over time and how
contemporary underpinnings inform the design process and resulting
products.

In her exploration of the role of bio-design and craft, Filiz Özbengi
Uslu questions whether design approaches embrace circular and
ecologically compatible alternatives to current models of fashion
production, and how these alternatives in the fashion design field
foster emotional attachment to clothes. As discussed in the paper, the
field of design is affected by the convergence of sustainability and
biodesign, as well as by tensions arising from technological advances
and the limitations imposed by the crisis environment. In relation to
these concerns, Elif Karakuş and Deniz Hasırcı explore the challenges of
using, transporting and storing props in sustainable stage design.
Driven by the contemporary environmental challenges posed by waste
materials in scenic design, this research comprehensively examines
obstacles inherent in the design process. Their research further
explores how professionals working in this particular field navigate and
address these challenges, proposing concurrently novel and practical
solutions responding to these urgent issues at hand.

Hande Yıldız Çekindir explores the theoretical foundations and practical
applications of “design thinking” in higher education by focusing on the
case of Izmir Design Factory. Izmir Design Factory is analyzed as a
bridge between academia and industry, emphasizing interdisciplinary
collaboration, skill development, and problem solving. Selen Çiçek
investigates the multifaceted nature of design space in computational
design within educational frameworks such as basic design studios and
explores the role of evolving generative AI in reconstructing design
problems and solutions. Anıl Dinçbilek discusses the concept of open
paradigm (OP) in the design field. OP exemplifies a shift from “closed
and exclusive” to “open and transparent” design process in a
transitioning design system.

Gökçe Çağatay, Tuba Doğu and Deniz Avci focus on the intersection of
gender and space, analyzing eleven selected films to reveal how domestic
and public spaces contribute to the perpetuation of violence against
women, arguing that the cinematic portrayal of violence serves as both a
reflection of societal realities and a tool for storytelling, raising
questions about its unconscious exploitation and social implications.

Prior to moving into localized discussions in the field of design
specific to Turkey and examining future directions and challenges,
Canberk Yurt explores the dualities immanent in the production and
consumption patterns. The focus in the paper is on understanding the
dynamics of supply and demand within the value-creation ecosystem.
Drawing on the conceptual framework that analyzes the transitions from
consumer to user and user to maker and prosumer concepts, the author
conducts a comparative analysis to reveal relational discussions among
stakeholders who are the representatives of the actions under
value-creation and transfer.
